# Hindi and Urdu: A Story of Names
**Untangling the complicated history of two of India’s biggest languages.**
### Part 1: An Ancient Tradition

---
*Here in Part 1 of the complicated history of Hindi and Urdu, we start from the origins of the languages and continue up to the mid-18th century, before the influence of British colonialism would be felt in India. In [Part 2](https://lingyourlanguage.com/?article=8), we take a look at just how the British were crucial to splitting Hindi and Urdu apart, and in [Part 3](https://lingyourlanguage.com/?article=7) we look at the role of nationalisms in the development of separate standard languages. In [Part 4](https://lingyourlanguage.com/?article=6), we conclude by looking at Hindi and Urdu from Indian independence up through the present day, and finally answer (or at least try to answer) our main questions: Are Hindi and Urdu separate languages?*

---

It was 1847, and the students of Dr. John R. Ballantyne, the Scottish superintendent of Government Sanskrit College in Benares, had been struggling to improve the style of their Hindi. One day, Dr. Ballantyne finally snapped, and asked them to write an essay on the following topic: 

>“Why do you despise the culture of the language you speak every day of your lives, of the only language which your mothers and sisters understand?”

To which one student replied:

>We do not clearly understand what you Europeans mean by the term Hindi, for there are hundreds of dialects, all in our opinion equally entitled to the name, and there is here no standard as there is in Sanskrit.[^1]

It wouldn’t be long, though, before the conception of Hindi had become a lot clearer. Today, there can be no doubt about the status of Hindi [in India]( https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Govt-to-promote-use-of-Hindi-in-routine-conversation-NE/articleshow/52659063.cms) and even in [the world](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/prime-minister-narendra-modi-to-address-un-general-assembly-in-hindi-rajnath-singh/article6409820.ece). [All sorts of stories](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/stories-they-tell-about-languages/article4747023.ece) have become a part of the mystique of Hindi. Languages older than Hindi are now considered by many to be dialects of it, poets once rejected are now praised.

And how did Urdu fit into all of this? The story of Hindi and Urdu is a tightly woven one, one surrounded by hopes, fears, political interests, mythologies, revised histories, and (oftentimes violent) conflict. 

The popular understanding of the situation now is that Hindi and Urdu are two distinct languages. But has that always been the case? In a country with [22 officially-recognized languages]( https://mha.gov.in/sites/default/files/Eighth_Schedule.pdf), why has the conflict between Hindi and Urdu in particular been so intense, so highly politicized?

Our journey will take us from the early days of the ancestors of Hindi and Urdu through the reign of the Mughal Empire and past the 1947 Partition of India to Hindi and Urdu today. We’ll see just what the role of Ballantyne and Government Sanskrit College in Benares was, how dialects and languages rose and fell, and how closely-related language and identity truly are. 

## The Early Days: Old and Middle Indo-Aryan[^2]
### The Rise of Sanskrit

Around 4,000 years ago, a group of Indo-Europeans nomads made their way into India. They called themselves *Ārya*, which likely meant “noble, honorable”, and their new land *Āryāvarta* “land of the noble”. They had made their way to the Indian subcontinent from the northwest and spoke an early language from the Indo-Aryan (IA) branch of the Indo-European language family.[^3]

Our earliest evidence of IA languages – and possibly of any Indo-European language, for that matter – is the *Rigveda*. This was one of four Vedas, the oldest and most sacred Hindu texts, which had been painstakingly preserved over the centuries from generation to generation – amazingly, they were passed down orally, and not through manuscripts. In fact, the texts that we have are fairly accurate, given that the Vedas originated somewhere around 1500 – 1200 BCE, centuries before Homer’s *Iliad* and *Odyssey*.[^4]

The language of all of the Vedas was **Sanskrit**, and as the language of the Hindu sacred texts, it had an unparalleled prestige among languages of the area – the very name “Sanskrit” comes from Sanskrit:  *sáṃskṛta* means “well-prepared, pure and perfect”.  It had the ultimate level of prestige, really – the Vedas were considered to have divine origin, and the language used to express them was perfect and sacred.

As an Indo-European language, Sanskrit shared many features with languages as distant as Latin or Ancient Greek,[^5] as well as even modern languages like English or French, but it was more closely related to the Indo-Iranian Persian language and even more closely related to the modern languages of India today, such as Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi, Bengali, and others.

### Out with the old, in with the middle

This sacred Sanskrit language eventually began to change, though, as any spoken language is bound to. This change was perceived as a threat to the Vedas, and it was the role of the some of the world’s first linguists to stop the change. Grammarians such as Panini, who wrote down almost 4,000 grammar rules of Sanskrit around 400 BCE,[^6] helped crystallize what is now known as [“Classical Sanskrit”](https://lrc.la.utexas.edu/eieol/vedol).[^7] Classical Sanskrit would go on to play an unimaginably influential role in the development of the IA languages.

At any rate, despite the grammarians’ best efforts at freezing Sanskrit, they only partially succeeded. They had frozen *written* Sanskrit, but the spoken language continued to change.

With the rise of two new religions, Buddhism and Jainism, around the 5th century BCE, new language varieties came into play. The followers of these new religions questioned the authority of the Vedas, and what better way to do that than to reject the prestige of Sanskrit? 

The early texts of Buddhism and Jainism, unsurprisingly, are thus written in other, non-Sanskrit varieties of what are called the Middle IA languages, to distinguish them from the Old IA languages such as Sanskrit. These languages came from the east, and as they spread west they formed a sort of *lingua franca* known as Pali.[^8]

Pali’s prestige was certainly helped by the fact that it was used in the texts of Theravada Buddhism, the most ancient school of Buddhism that still exists today. On top of this, the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka helped spread Pali far and wide as a *koine*, or common language between dialects, around 250 BCE by putting up inscriptions on pillars across India.[^10]

But again, as time passed, one language made way for another, and Pali was eventually replaced by what is known as Prakrit. We know about this language mostly through dramas, as well as the religious writings of the Jains.

Around the 6th century CE, Prakrit was slowly replaced by a new type of Prakrit language known as Apabhramsha – the new *lingua franca*. This language developed a rich literature across North India, and by the 12th century there were a number of varieties in use. 

One variety of Apabhramsha in particular, though, known as **Saurseni Apabhramsha**, was especially important: **it would end up being the mother of what are now called the Western Hindi languages, which include Hindi and Urdu.** 

## The Muslim Influence
### The Delhi Sultanate

Just after 1100, Mahmud of Ghazni, Sultan of the Ghaznavid Empire and first sovereign ruler to be known as sultan, conquered the Punjab region in the northwest part of India. The Ghaznavid Empire was a Muslim dynasty with Turkic origins, and they had a highly “Persianized” society. Though Turkish literary culture did persist for a while, the Ghaznavid court operated in Persian, and [Persian was the language of all things cultural]( http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ghaznavids). 

With the conquest of Delhi in 1192, the Delhi Sultanate came into being, and after that, Muslim rule expanded east at an astonishing rate. By the 14th century, the Delhi Sultanate controlled most of India, apart from some isolated areas such as Rajasthan and the extreme south.[^11]

**This was the start of a long period of Muslim political dominance, which would have significant impacts on the development of India. And those influences would be felt perhaps nowhere more than in the use of languages.**

#### Khari Boli and Persian

Let’s take a closer look at the Persian that the elite of the Delhi Sultanate were speaking.

The Persian that was brought into (especially North) India was special. Originally, with the rapid expansion of Islam in the 7th century CE, communities that adopted the religion also adopted the Arabic language due to the religious significance of the Quran being written in it. 

In eastern Iran and Central Asia, though, Arabic just didn’t quite stick the way it had in the Middle East and North Africa. Instead, Persians began using the Arabic script (with some modifications) and adopted an absolutely vast quantity of Arabic loan words, foreign sounds and all (bearing in mind that Arabic is entirely unrelated to Persian and Indo-European languages in general).[^12]

The political domination of the Delhi Sultanate in North India spread both Islam and this Arabicized Persian across India. It was patronized lavishly by the political elite, and all high-prestige literature, education, and administration was conducted in it.[^13] 

But the spoken language was a different story. 

The spoken language of Delhi was not so much one dialect as it was a mixture of many. Several Indian languages including (but not limited to) Braj, Haryanvi, Punjabi, and Rajasthani all played a role in the creation of Khari Boli, the speech of Delhi.[^14] And it wasn’t just Indian languages in the mix. Language contact between Persian and Arabic speakers and Khari Boli speakers also resulted in many new sounds and a healthy dose of Persian and Arabic loan words.[^15]

Now, although the Indian languages are related to Persian (both are Indo-Iranian languages), they are not mutually intelligible.  For all its prestige and use among the elite and in the courts, Persian (for the most part) just couldn’t compete with the widespread use of Khari Boli. Khari Boli was spoken[^16] across the northern region of India, from Fatehgarh Sahib in the far northwest to what constitutes modern-day Uttar Pradesh (UP) in the north.[^17]

Khari Boli, now in stable shape in the capital, became the *lingua franca* of the north – and over time, more and more of India – and would go on to provide the basis for Hindi, Urdu, and Hindustani.

For the sake of using a name with a clear connection to its continued use as the *lingua franca* of much of India (or, earlier, “Hindustan”), we will refer to Khari Boli as **Hindustani**.[^18]

This also helps with precision. Speakers of just about any Indian language across the continent referred to their own language as “Hindi”, whether it be the Khari Boli dialect of any other. This was a legacy of the Muslims, who had used the words *hindī* “Indian language” and *hindvī* “Hindi language” to describe just about any Indian language – they were fairly indifferent about the whole issue.[^19]

Hindustani was by no means the only language spoken by people in India, of course. The 12th century saw a number of Indo-Aryan dialects splitting off from the different Apabhramshas and flourishing in their own rights. In the west, there was Rajasthani and Gujarati; in the south Marathi; in the east, Maithili and Bhojpuri; and further east Bengali, Assamese, and Oriya.

Likewise, Persian was by no means the only literary language with any prestige. Rajasthani, for example, found favor among the smaller Rajput courts of north, west, and central India. In addition, in and around Lucknow, Muslim rulers also patronized an Eastern Hindi language known as Avadhi. This led to the development of a major tradition of Sufi (Islam) verse.[^20]

#### Planting the seeds of Urdu literary tradition

Literary language or not, Hindustani would soon be spread across India over the course of the Delhi Sultanate’s rule (1211 – 1504). Muslim armies conquered the subcontinent and populations moved to fill up the conquered lands and brought Hindustani with them.

Two of the Sultanate’s expansions are especially relevant to the development of Hindustani. Even though it would be quite a while before the name Urdu caught on among speakers, it is nevertheless clear that expansion southwards was the beginning of the literary tradition of what is now called Urdu.

The first was expansion south into Gujarat. In 1297, Alauddin Khalji (ruled 1296 – 1316), annexed Gujarat into the Delhi Sultanate. This would initiate a large movement of people that would only increase after Timur, the first ruler of the Timurid dynasty of Central Asia, sacked Delhi in 1398. 

By the early 15th century, Hindustani had become so popular in Gujarat that *it even began to influence Persian*. In this region, the local names for the language were abandoned in favor of Gujri, though “Hindi” continued to be used alongside it.[^21]

The Sufis developed Gujri into a literary language, and as Muslims, they wrote in the Perso-Arabic script. The development of Gujri as a literary language defined what could be called “the parameters of Urdu language and literature” – the language, the form, the themes, and so on. 

**In other words, the literary tradition established in Gujarat can be considered one part of Urdu’s earliest literary tradition**.[^22]

The second expansion was into the Deccan, the large plateau rising up from southern and western India. Right on the heels of their Gujarati counterparts, the Sufis in the Deccan would lead the charge in creating another early variety of Urdu.

Most of the expansion came during the rule of Sultan Muhammad bin Tughlaq (ruled 1325 – 1351), when there was a large migration of the population from Delhi to Daulatabad and Aurangabad in the Deccan. Sometimes these migrations were voluntary, such as Hindu merchants and Sufi mystics and preachers who moved south for business or to establish new religious centers. But sometimes they were not quite as voluntary – in 1327, Sultan Tughlaq moved the capital from Delhi to and forcibly brought the population, and so Hindustani as well, with him.[^23]

Persian was virtually unknown in the south at this time, and the Sufis who wanted to spread their message decided to use the Hindustani they had brought from the north. As they brought Hindustani south, it picked up some Punjabi features, as well as influences from the local dialects of the Deccan along the way. 

The final result was a variety of Hindustani spoken in the Deccan that was full of *tadbhava*, “indigenous words” – words that with their origins in Middle IA rather than foreign languages – with a sprinkling of Persian or Arabic words. Over time, the number of words borrowed from Persian and Arabic increased.[^24]

This variety came to be known as *Dakhanī* (lit., “southern”), *Hindwī*, or *Dehlavī*, and was written in the Perso-Arabic script, a decision which would have important consequences later on. 

Once established, Dakhani would explode in popularity in southern India over the course of the next two centuries.[^25] Rulers of many of the Muslim kingdoms, notably in Bijapur and Golkunda (modern-day Hyderabad), began patronizing it. By the 17th century, Dakhani had established a rich literature for itself in a wide variety of genres. 

**This was the other founding moment of Urdu literary tradition.**

### Enter Mughals

The Delhi Sultanate would not last forever, and it was eventually defeated by the Mughal Empire in 1526. The Mughals had roots in the Timurid dynasty of Central Asia but were heavily steeped in Indo-Persian culture. This meant that Persian was the official language of the court, and that it was spoken and written by the Mughal elites and nobles, at least in official (or high-cultural) contexts.[^26]

#### The Situation in North India

From the late 15th century on, and especially beginning in the reign of Emperor Akbar from 1556 – 1605, the Mughal government patronized the western language *Braj Bhāsā* as well as the eastern language Avadhi. These languages were patronized alongside Persian by both Hindus and Muslims, and a rich (and mostly religious) literary tradition developed around them. 

Braj in particular became nearly as prestigious as a literary language as Persian,[^27] and even Emperor Akbar himself tried his hand at it.[^28]

And just to confuse things, it was also around this time that **in North India, the term “Hindi” came to refer specifically to Braj.**[^29]

But what about the spoken language in the north?

Continued military presence in an area is not self-sustaining. It needs someone to run it, and it needs resources. In this way, the Persian-speaking administrative and commercial aspects of the Muslim rulers had a huge impact. The result was that up to the 17th century, even though Hindustani was the main vernacular, Persian was at the very least understood by much of the north Indian urban population.[^30]

That Persian was so widely-understood in the North had serious consequences in its own right. To take one example, it meant that contrary to in the south, the Sufis of the north were perfectly comfortable in Persian and saw no reason to use Hindustani at all. 

In the late 17th century, the Delhi elite, in love with all things Persian, began patronizing what was known as Rekhtah, in a conscious attempt to write in a Persianized Hindustani. Rekhtah, which meant “mixed” in Persian,[^31] was a form of poetry written in a mixture of Hindustani and Persian inside of a Persian poetic template.[^32] This can be considered the earliest form of the early Urdu variety of Hindustani, or Urdu-Hindustani.

This was also the earliest stage of the “Muslimization” of Urdu, as the Muslim elite patronized it heavily. This patronage would ultimately be the driving force behind the rise of Urdu.[^33]

In the south, things were quite the opposite: though Rekhtah had made its way there, it would never reach anywhere near the same levels of popularity as it did in the north, given the massive popularity of Gujri and Dakhani.[^34]

Before we move on, it is worth taking a moment to consider why Dakhani became a prestigious literary language, flourishing among these southern Muslim kingdoms of the Deccan, all the while in North India Hindustani was seen as such a low language, undeserving of cultivation.

For Dakhani in the south, one of the major force driving forces was cultural identity. Language is a powerful way of drawing the boundaries of an identity. So, in response to increasing pressure from the Mughal Empire, which was on its way to conquering the entire Indian subcontinent, **the Muslim kingdoms used language – Dakhani in particular – to assert an identity distinct from the Persian-speaking Mughals.**

In the north, Hindustani was the *lingua franca*, and in fact a highly successful one at that.

But the attitudes of the elite towards Hindustani were generally negative. Hindustani was seen as little more than a “mongrel *patois*” that was only necessary for communication between the indigenous population and the foreign rulers.[^35] Neither Muslims nor Hindus in North India had any real desire to turn it into a literary language.[^36] This meant that there just had not been the same opportunities for Hindustani to establish a literary tradition as there had been in the south, and so development of the literary tradition was significantly slowed down. One way or another, Delhi literary circles were biased against Dakhani – against anything non-Delhi, really.

#### Vali visits Delhi

In 1657, Emperor Aurangzeb seized the Mughal throne. He immediately set to work on conquering the Deccan kingdoms, and the rest of the southern Muslim kingdoms quickly fell under Mughal control. Breaking up the kingdoms during the conquests meant that the royal courts were dissolved, which had the side effect of scattering the artists and poets of those courts far and wide.[^37]

Some of the poets displaced by Aurangzeb’s conquests ended up going back north. This meant that the north would finally be exposed to the Dakhani variety of Hindustani. It would have to compete with Braj, Avadhi, and Persian, of course, which would be no mean feat.[^38]

One of the poets who moved north was Wali (1667 – 1707/8), born in Aurangabad.[^39] Even before arriving in Delhi around 1700, Wali was already an established poet in the south. Once in Delhi, he revolutionized the field. **He showed the elite of North India once and for all that Hindustani was capable of poetry just as good as any Indo-Persian poetry.**[^40]

On the whole, he was well-received by the *literati* of Delhi. However, there was still a general feeling of uncertainty, given that Wali was an outsider, and a Dakhani outsider at that.

But their ambivalence could not have been due to the actual language he was using. Wali’s poetry was not pure Dakhani, but rather more like Rekhtah influenced by Dakhani and Gujri. In fact, whatever Dakhani influences that could be seen were almost entirely limited to *tadbhav* - the indigenous words the elite later worked so hard to eliminate. But at the time of Wali’s visit most of these would not have been unfamiliar to speakers of the Delhi dialect.[^41]

No, the real problem was that Wali was not himself from Delhi. All non-Delhi speech – even if an elite was speaking it – was looked down on.[^42] Admitting that Wali had revolutionized poetry would be an admission that a non-Delhi poet had come in and, rather than learning from the Delhi poets, had actually taught *them* something. 

The Delhi elite quickly took up arms. Later leading poets such as Mir (1722 – 1810) and Qayem Chandpuri (1724/25 – 1794) took the lead in trying to diminish his achievements.[^43] After all, if they could show that Wali’s poetry wasn’t actually influenced by Dakhani, but rather by Persian / Delhi poetry, it would certainly fit their story of the supremacy of Delhi poetry a lot better.[^44]

#### From Hindustani to Urdu

And so they began a “purification” of Hindustani. Contemporary influential poets such as Arzu (1689- 1756), Shah Hatim (1699 – 1781) and Jan-e-Janaan (1699 – 1781) worked to remove both Braj words and obviously indigenous words. After all, “correct” Hindustani couldn’t just be the language of the masses. No, “correct” Hindustani was the “elevated”, Persian-influenced kind spoken in the court.[^45]

It was this language that the elite considered their own, and which they wanted to give the status of Persian. This meant replacing Persian as the language of the royal city – the *zabān-e urdū-e mu’allā*.[^46]

Even the Emperor was speaking the Persianized Hindustani. In January 1772, the sixteenth Mughal Emperor, Shah Alam II, moved back to Delhi and took up residence at the Red Fort. Shah Alam was an avid lover of languages. He patronized both Sanskrit as well as Hindustani, which, due in large part to years in Allahabad, he spoke in informal situations. He even tried his hand at writing something more substantial in it (although he identifies the language he was writing in as “Hindi”, of course). By speaking Hindustani, Shah Alam raised its prestige significantly. 

This Persianized Hindustani’s prestige grew enough that the *zabān-e urdū-e mu’allā* began shifting towards it and away from Persian. It was *this* specific variety carved out by the Delhi elite that would go on to be called **Urdu**, shortened from * zabān-e urdū-e mu’allā*, and which was supposedly distinct from the Hindustani of the masses.[^47] (From now on, we’ll refer to that Persianized Hindustani by the name Urdu as well.)  

In this way, the Mughals played a key role in the spread of Urdu. Wherever their power extended, so too did Urdu.[^48]

[^1]: Quoted in King (1992: 184). The student continues: "If the purity of Hindi is to consist in its exclusion of Mussulman words, we shall require to study Persian and Arabic in order to ascertain which of the words we are in the habit of issuing every day is Arabic or Persian, and which is Hindi. With our present knowledge we can tell that a word is Sanscrit, or not Sanscrit but if not Sanscrit, it may be English or Portuguese instead of Hindi for anything that we can tell. English words are becoming as completely naturalized in the villages as Arabic and Persian words, and that you call the Hindi will eventually merge in some future modification of the Oordoo, nor do we see any great cause of regret in this prospect."

It was perhaps around 1000 BCE – an approximate date at best – that all of the ancient poems were gathered together, with the addition of some newer materials, and reorganized them into the Rigveda (lit. ‘praise-knowledge”) that we have today. Other arrangements of the poems with alterations for specific purposes, such as a rearrangement of the poems and alternate readings for the purpose of chanting, resulted in the other Vedas, the Samaveda, Yajurveda, and Atharvaveda. The Vedas were accompanied by a growing body of commentary known as the Brāhmaṇas.

[^5]: In fact, the study of Sanskrit by philologist William Jones provided the inspiration for his observation about the relationship between the Indo-European languages: "The *Sanscrit* language, whatever be its antiquity, is of a wonderful structure; more perfect than the *Greek*, more copious than the *Latin*, and more exquisitely refined than either, yet bearing to both of them a stronger affinity, both in the roots of verbs and the forms of grammar, than could possibly have been produced by accident; so strong indeed, that no philologer could examine them all three, without believing them to have sprung from some common source, which, perhaps, no longer exists; there is a similar reason, though not quite so forcible, for supposing that both the *Gothic* and the *Celtic*, though blended with a very different idiom, had the same origin with the *Sanscrit*; and the old *Persian* might be added to the same family."

[^7]: The term “Sanskrit” generally refers to “Classical Sanskrit”. For discussions of the term “Vedic Sanskrit” see [this page](http://www.rigveda.co.uk/), run by Prof. Karen Thomson of the University of Texas at Austin.

[^8]: This classification is not strictly chronological. That is, the Middle Indo-Aryan languages are not necessarily “younger” than (Classical) Sanskrit. In fact, some show linguistic features which reveal that they did not descend from the Sanskrit of the *Rigveda*, but rather other dialects that are in some respects even more archaic than Rigvedic Sanskrit (Oberlies 2004: 179).

[^12]: Persian was not limited to Muslims, either. Elementary mosque-schools (*maktab*) conducted in Persian appealed even to Hindus who wanted a chance at working in the government bureaucracy. Certain Hindu castes, such as the Kayasths, became especially known for their knowledge of Persian and were often scribes, clerks, and administrators (Shackle and Snell 1990: 3).
All of this is not to say that *all* Hindus were willing to accept Persian’s status, and Hindu elementary schools (*pāthsālā*) run by Hindu pandits (teachers) sprung up to rival the *maktab.* 

[^13]: One possible etymology given by Masica (1991: 28): < *kharā* ‘standing’, and so ‘stand[ard dialect]’.

[^14]: For a detailed description of foreign elements in Hindustani, see Chapter 4, and esp. §4.5, in Masica (1991).

[^15]: Though Khari Boli was a principally spoken dialect, there were some attempts at writing it, However, as a whole, there was no serious, sustained effort at producing any literary works in it. 
Interestingly, one of the leading poet of the 14th century, Amir Khusrau, devoted a long section of one of his poems (*Nūh sipihr*, “Nine Heavens”) to praise of India. He praised “Indian speech” – that is, Khari Boli - saying that it was better than Persian or Turkish because of its “pleasing vocabulary.” 
Despite this praise, Khusrau himself wrote very little in Khari Boli, and evidently didn’t consider any of what he did write worth saving. This, from a man distinguished in Persian and Arabic poetry, is one key confirmation of Khari Boli’s lack of prestige in North India at the time.

[^17]: The name “Hindustani” would not catch on among its speakers until much later, around the 18th century. Hindustani went by many names, including (but not limited to) “Hindi”, “Dehlavi”, “Hindwi”, and “Rekhta” (Chand 1944: 86).

[^24]: Dakhani – whether it be considered Dakhani Hindi or Dakhani Urdu – is still spoken to this day, and  is centered in Hyderabad, the capital of Andhra Pradesh, with significant communities of Muslim speakers from the Deccan Plateau. The modern version also shows significant influence from the local Dravidian language Telugu. (Shapiro 2014: 277).

[^25]: What the actual spoken vernacular of the Mughal court was at is hard to know, but it does not appear that there was any *one* language that served this purpose, but rather “a diverse collection of languages, different languages for different people on different occasions.” This is true at least up to the 18th century. In the first Mughal emperor Babur’s (1483 – 1530) memoirs we find the Turki language, but by the time that Humayun (1508 – 1556) succeeded him, Babur only used Turki when he didn’t want people to understand a conversation he was having. Still, Akbar’s (142 – 1605) wet nurse spoke Turki, and Akbar himself wanted his son to learn it. Persian was, of course, the language of the courts and of anything official, but apart from native-born Iranians, it was no one’s first language (Lelyveld 1994: 65).

[^26]: There were two main factors that helped Braj gain this prestige:
1 - An explosion of poetry dedicated to the Hindu deity Krishna in the 16th century. **This poetry provided the basis for the use of Braj in a variety of genres.** One of the great works of Braj poetry praising Krishna was by (the semi-legendary) Surdas, a blind poet and singer.
2 - The Mughal capital around this time was in Agra, in northern India where the Taj Mahal would later be built. Agra was already dominated by Braj, and being the literary language of the capital only furthered its prestige.

[^30]: Persian lexicography of the  14th-15th centuries indicates that while Hindustani was making inroads into Persian’s dominance, a large number of people were still reading Persian (Faruqi 2001: 116).

[^32]: At least, this is what Rekhtah originally referred to. It soon came to refer to the very language that that genre was being composed in, and poets began writing in all sorts of different genres of poetry, all still in Rekhtah. Finally – and just to add to the confusion – Rekhtah came to refer just to the plain Hindustani language of the area. 
To provide a more vivid idea of just how mixed Rekhtah is, Faruqi (2001: 117) provides a schematic translation of the first ten *shi’rs* of a *maṣnavī* by the poet Ṣalah (Faruqi uses “Urdu” to refer to what we are calling – for the moment – Hindustani):
1 - First line: Persian. Second line: first three words Persian, then an Urdu verb, then the last two words Persian of a construction not used in Urdu at all.
2 - First line: Persian. Second line: first word an Urdu verb, the rest Persian, but such that it could pass for Urdu.
3 - First line: Persian. Second line: first three words Persian, then an Urdu verb, then the last two words Persian of a construction not used in Urdu at all.
4 - First line: could pass for Urdu because it has an Urdu verb; the rest Persian, but assimilable in Urdu. Second line: the first word a Persian verb, the rest Persian, but assimilable in Urdu.
5 - First line: Persian. Second line: the first four words Urdu, followed by a two-word Persian  construction not used in Urdu at all.
6 - First line: Persian. Second line: Urdu.
7 - First line: Persian. Second line: Urdu.
8 - First line: a Persian verb followed by an Urdu construction, then the last two words Persian, but assimilable in Urdu. Second line: Persian.
9 - First line: Urdu. Second line: Persian.
10 - First line: Urdu. Second line: Persian.

[^33]: The Hindus of North India were initially content with Braj and Awadhi, although many of them were attracted to Urdu (especially those in close contact with the Muslim administration) (Das Gupta 1970: 52).

[^36]: According to Muhammad Aufi’s *Pure Essences of the Intellect* (*Lubab ul-albab*), the great poet Amir Khusrau (1253 – 1325) wrote some verses in what he referred to as *Hindvī*, but did not regard them as any sort of serious effort. Hindi/Hindvi had not yet developed enough prestige for any author to be willing to publish in it.

[^37]: Chand 1944: 29.

[^38]: For Braj, see footnote 26; Avadhi was popularized as a literary language by poets such as Kabir and Malik Muhammad Jayasi, and on the foundations they laid such great works as Tulasidas’ *Ramcharitamanas* was written.

[^39]: According to Faruqi (2001: 129), the exact info of Wali’s birth are not known with perfect accuracy. He was born in 1665 or 1667, possibly in Aurangabad but also possibly in Gujarat. 
Regarding the date of his death, it is likely that Wali died in 1707/8. This is the date of his final manuscript, and given the remarkable state of preservation of his works, it seems unlikely that Wali’s literary record, so to speak, would just cut off abruptly. Furthermore, Wali mentions a number of Persian contemporaries, as well as three Dakhani ones, but not a single Rekhtah poet of the north, perhaps because he was not around to see Rekhtah become a major presence in Delhi beginning around 1710.

[^40]: Further evidence of Wali’s lasting appeal is that about one hundred manuscripts of his *dīwāns*, or collections of poetry, have survived three centuries of intense political and social change that would come after him.

[^41]: Faruqi 2001: 138.

[^42]: This obsession became so extreme – the story goes – that Mir wouldn’t even speak to his travelling companions for the duration of a trip from Delhi to Lucknow out of fear that his own speech would be corrupted (Rai 2001: 74).
Ironically, when Lucknow became the center of the Muslim aristocracy, their obsession with Persianization would make the one in Delhi look mild.

[^43]: The most prominent story told about Wali and his time in Delhi goes a long way towards explaining the intellectual attitude of the Delhi elite of the time – and even now. The main story, as told by Mir, can be summarized as follows: When Wali arrived in Delhi in 1700, he consulted with Shah Gulshan, a saint and poet. Shah Gulshan advised him to make use of the Persian literary tradition, rather than the new-fangled language he had brought. Wali took the advice to heart, and when he went back to Delhi in 1720 with a new diwan, it took the city by storm and everyone adopted his style of poetry.
The main problem with this story is the year of Wali’s death. This is a political question, as the longer Wali was alive after taking Shah Gulshan’s advice, the more he can be said to have been influenced by the Persian poetry of the Delhi elite. This would mean that the Delhi elite would be able to claim that *they* influenced *him*, rather than the other way around.
Another problem is more of a hypothetical. It is certainly likely that Wali met with Shah Gulshan if they were both in Delhi at the same time, and there is even a strong possibility that they already knew each other. However, one question remains: Why did Shah Gulshan – a minor poet – wait for someone from outside of Delhi, or even specifically for Wali, to come to Delhi to give the advice to make use of more Persian themes in his Rekhtah? There were plenty of poets in Delhi already fluent in Persian who were trying their hands at Rekhtah as well who could just as easily have received the advice (Faruqi 2001: 129).
Chandpuri also tells a story in which Wali was not even that well-known of a poet before he met with Shah Gulshan, who encouraged him to write some more verses. This **cannot** be true, however. We have the testimony of some of Wali’s contemporaries who died *before* 1700 that indicates that he was already a serious Rekhtah poet. See Faruqi (2001:137) for quotations of these contemporaries and further arguments against Chandpuri’s story.

[^44]: In a letter dated August 15, 1967, Habib ur-Rahman al-Siddiqi Merathi, an educated man from a distinguished family from Meerut who considered his speech the same as that of Delhi, wrote “[Wali] has been given too much of a *boost*; he needs to be *debunked*.” Two weeks later he added that “[Wali] learned [proper] Urdu when he came to Delhi; its not that he taught [proper] Urdu to the people of Delhi” (italics in original; quoted in Faruqi 2001: 130, note 2).

[^45]: Lexicographer Syed Maulvi Ahmed Dehalvi, author of *Farhang-i-Asafiya*, derogatorily calls the Hindustani of the people “Purdu”, while “Urdu” is restricted to the dialect of the elite. He adds (quoted in  Rai 2001: 76): "…Nor do we approve of that Urdu which is used by the Christians of Hindustan, by newly-converted Muslims, by foreigners newly arrived, by their cooks and attendants, and by rural folk from the Eastern districts…"

[^46]: Regarding the origins of the  term, in the mid-18th century we find leading Delhi poets such as Mir and Arzu using phrases with the word *urdū* to describe the royal city, Delhi. 46 Mir, for example, describes Rekhta as being spoken in the *urdū-e mu’allā* – the royal city.46 Around the same time, Arzu stated that the Persian of the *urdū* was the “true” Persian.
But it would not be until 1796 that we actually find the first explicit, written use of “Urdu” as a *language name.* In a verse, the poet Mashafi refers to **Persian** as the *zabān-e urdū-e mu’allā-e shāhjahānābād*, or “language of the exalted city/court of Shahjahanabad” (which meant Delhi, at least until the early 19th century).

# Hindi and Urdu: A Story of Names
### Part 3: Nationalisms

---
*Here in Part 3, we take a look at the role of Hindu and Muslim nationalists in pushing the Hindi and Urdu standards further and further apart up to Indian independence in 1946. In [Part 1](https://lingyourlanguage.com/article/Hindi%20and%20Urdu:%20A%20Story%20of%20Names,%20Part%201:%20An%20Ancient%20Tradition) we traced the origins of Hindi and Urdu back to their Sanskrit roots, and in [Part 2](https://lingyourlanguage.com/article/Hindi%20and%20Urdu:%20A%20Story%20of%20Names,%20Part%202:%20The%20Hindi-Urdu%20Split) we examined the influence of British colonialism on the separation of Hindi and Urdu. In [Part 4](https://lingyourlanguage.com/article/Hindi%20and%20Urdu:%20A%20Story%20of%20Names,%20Part%204:%20Hindi%20and%20Urdu%20from%20Independence%20to%20Today), we'll conclude by looking at Hindi and Urdu from Indian independence up through the present day, and finally answer (or at least try to answer) our main questions: Are Hindi and Urdu separate languages?*

### The beginning of a rivalry

To put it simply, competition with Urdu – the dominant Indo-Persian culture of the 18th and 19th centuries[^84] – was far and away the most prominent influence on Modern Hindi. Whatever setbacks they might have faced before, it was their time to shine now, and the Hindus *needed* to distinguish themselves from the “unforgivably disloyal” Muslims of 1857. This meant two things: defining Hindi (which really meant denying the obvious connection between the origins of Urdu and Hindi), and cozying up with the British to gain influence.[^85]

In the years following the Indian Rebellion there was a flurry of pro-Hindi and pro-Nagari script activity, especially in the Northwest Provinces and Oudh (NWP&O). The Benares Institute was founded in 1861 and the Allahabad institute just a few years later; both would become important centers of Hindi/Nagari advocacy.[^86]

Benares, for instance, would play a leading role in the development of Hindi nationalism. It was here that the Nagari Pracharini Sabha (NPS), or Society for the Promotion of Naragi, was founded in 1893. The NPS grew quickly. Before long, its membership was in the hundreds, and it was receiving thousands of rupees in donations. 

The NPS would play an outsized role in defining Hindi, at least until around World War I, at which point the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan (HSS), or Society for Hindi Literature, founded in Allahabad in 1910, became the primary Hindi institution.[^87]

But that was all to come. Directly after the rebellion in 1857, there were two main bases of support for Hindi.

One was among writers and educators, who were generally supporters of the Sanskritic Hindu tradition. They were not, however, so fanatical about Sanskritizing Hindi, as they were strongly influenced by educational norms of the time, which included teaching young students Persian.

The second was the reformist Hindu movement, notably the organization known as the **Arya Samaj**, founded in 1875. Inspired in part by the successful standardization of Bengali, this group put Sanskrit on a pedestal, and were willing to go to great lengths to restore it to its former glory.[^88] The Hindi that would develop here would be a highly-Sanskritized one, the Sanskrit counterpart of the highly-Persianized Urdu patronized by the Urdu elite.[^89]

The Arya Samaj’s proposals were rejected by most of the more traditional Hindu organizations. Internal religious controversies erupted between these groups, leading to an extreme increase in publishing and public speaking, all in Hindi. Though Hindu society was not reformed as much the Arya Samaj had wanted, they were successful in reforming Hindi. The highly-Sanskritized Hindi (“school Hindi”) was the new standard, and even became a mandatory subject in all Arya Samaj educational institutions.

The Hindi movement also found strong support among Bengalis. Bengal was educating its citizens – in Hindi – faster than it could do anything with them, and so these citizens started making their way west in search of better lives. 

This large, new population of Bengalis in the northwest was one of the earliest bases of support for Hindi as a national language. Bengalis were prominent in pro-Hindi mobilization efforts and could be found in important positions at the Benares Institute and Allahabad Institute, the centers of the Hindi movement.

The newly-arrived Bengalis were met with hostilities by the NWP&O elite, which consisted mainly of Muslims. The Bengalis played up the democratic nature of their position. Given their population numbers, Muslims were vastly overrepresented in the elite, which meant that Hindi nationalists and pro-Hindi Bengalis had to actively fight against the elite for Hindi’s recognition. This was used as a rallying cry, reinforcing the element of Hindi being a socially disadvantaged language that was built into the very roots of the Hindi movement.[^90]

#### Nagari: An inseparable part of Hindi 

The conflict between the Nagari and Perso-Arabic scripts would be one of the most visible symbols of the ever-growing divide between Hindi and Urdu.

Script was often confused with language. “Hindi”, “Hindi character”, “Nagari”, and “Nagari character” were essentially interchangeable, while on the other side “Persian”, “Persian character”, and “Urdu” were constantly confused.[^91] This identification of language and script hinted at public perceptions that script and language were equivalent.

The Nagari script was a non-negotiable position in the Hindi supporter platform. They presented it as an issue of democracy: the Nagari script was the democratic underdog against the authoritarian Perso-Arabic script of the Muslim oppressors – an exaggerated position, but not without a kernel of truth. 

The argument was that the Nagari script was so much more widely known the Perso-Arabic one, and so using it would be a much more democratic option and would have numerous benefits for all of Indian society. That’s the kernel of truth – they *were* correct in stating that more people were familiar with the Nagari script, and that using it could bring benefits to the underrepresented Hindu population.

The problem is that another script, Kaithi – a sort of cursive of the Nagari script – was *even more* widely used than the Devanagari form of the Nagari script advocated for by Hindi ideologues.[^92] But they rejected this form, because it was perceived to be associated with Hindustani rather than Sanskrit, and because both Hindus and Muslims were familiar with it, meaning it might not be “pure” enough, among other reasons.[^93] In other words it was no *Deva*nagari – *deva* meaning “heavenly, divine” or referring to Hindu deities.[^94]

Whatever their reasons, the fact of the matter was that Nagari was put forth as *the* script of Hindi, and it was a demand that they would not compromise on.

#### A problem defining Hindi, or: The Story of Ayodhya Prasad Khattri

At the end of the 19th century, the foundations of Hindi had certainly been set. It was to be written in the Nagari script, and it showed strong Sanskrit influences. But its development as a literary language was by no means complete yet, and there was a major development still to come. 

Now, Hindi meant two things, even in the context of literary languages. For prose, it meant the highly-Sanskritized style developed in places such as Fort William College and the Arya Samaj. For poetry, though, it still referred to Braj, which was holding onto its position as the dominant poetic language that it had had since the late 15th century.

In 1887, one Ayodhya Prasad Khattri published a book (at his own expense) titled *Khari Boli ka Padya.* In it, he argued that Khari Boli – that is, Hindustani, the foundation (and common ground) of Hindi and Urdu –  should not just be the language of prose, but also of poetry. Hindustani, he argued, was just as good as language for poetry as Braj was, even if no literary tradition existed for it yet, and should replace it.[^95]

Khattri set out a few different classifications of Hindustani. Three are relevant here:

1. “Pandit” style, which was the heavily-Sanskritized variety being advocated for by Hindi ideologues. 
2. “Maulvi” style, which was the Persianized and Arabicized version.
3. The style Khattri preferred, a sort of middle ground between the two, the common Hindustani widely spoken and understood across India.[^96]

The claim wasn’t even anything particularly revolutionary. Bhartendu Harishchandra, considered the father of Modern Hindi, had already advocated for the common Hindustani style for prose. And Khattri did not intend to be revolutionary, either. All he wanted was to move away from the archaic Braj and to persuade those writing in Urdu to switch over to Nagari. It would be a compromise: Urdu speakers would abandon their script and write in the Nagari script instead, and Hindi speakers would abandon Braj and use the common Hindustani variety as the basis for prose.

Given how *not* revolutionary this was, the extreme reaction to the ideas in his book shows just how important the issues at hand were.

Years after he had published the book, Khattri showed up at a meeting of the NPS in Benares. His response was less than friendly, to put it mildly:

>Khattri was treated with conspicuous hostility. While “B.A. Pass Babu Shyam Sundar Das”, the Nagari Pracharini Sabha busybody, cajoled Guleri [another writer] to join the group that was being photographed to mark the inauguration, he pointedly ignored Khattri. Eventually, someone noticed the aged crank [Khattri] who was the father of it all [i.e. Khari Boli Hindi].[^97]

The fatal flaw in Khattri’s arguments for Hindustani over Braj as the basis for Hindi poetry was that he argued that they were different languages. This idea subverted what Hindi ideologues had been working so hard on for so long. Hindustani, with its obvious connections to *Urdu*, just wouldn’t cut it as *Hindi’s* literary variety – at least when Khattri presented it. Khattri’s opponents defended Braj as strongly as they did *specifically because of its perceived distance from Urdu.*^[98]

There was something quite odd  about the general controversy that arose as a result of the publication of *Khari Boli ka Padya* and Khattri’s activism on behalf of Hindustani. Very early on in its existence, the NPS felt that the fact that Hindi had two different varieties for its literary standard – Braj for poetry and Sanskritized Hindustani for prose – presented a major obstacle to the unity of Hindi. But when Khattri came around and proposed a way to solve this issue, he was completely shunned.

The debate would last quite a while, with arguments in favor of and against both Braj and Sanskritized Hindustani. The main argument against common Hindustani was that it would spread the influence of Urdu (due to the perceived connection between the two).[^99]

The debate, however, ultimately turned in favor of Sanskritized Hindustani – the Pandit style being advocated by ideologues – when Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi, editor of the most influential Hindi periodical of the early 20th century, began writing poetry in a Sanskritized Hindustani and encouraged anyone who submitted to the journal to do the same.[^100]

And so after all there was no compromise. The literary variety of Hindi would be based entirely on the highly-Sanskritized version of Hindustani.

#### A bump in the road

Taking the Hindi movement’s arguments to the British, Raja Shivaprasad, a prominent Education Department official, submitted a memorandum in 1868 concerning the official language of British administration. His arguments were not about the language itself, but rather *specifically against the Perso-Arabic script.* The arguments were on the basis of cultural identity: the Semitic script, he argued, alienated the Indian people from their Aryan speech, which made it unsuitable as the official script.[^101] 

At first, the British responded that they would think about it – in other, words, they did nothing. But after receiving another memorandum in favor of Hindi/Nagari (we’ll refer to this as just Hindi from now on) with the usual arguments in 1873, they actually spat in the face of Hindi supporters and issued an order requiring proficiency in *Urdu* - in the Perso-Arabic script – for all government positions above a certain level.[^102]

This decree was especially insulting, given that the educational system implemented by the British was teaching Indians standardized forms of local languages or of Hindi,[^103] but now it was *Urdu* proficiency that was required in order to make it in the government. The order would be rescinded in 1896, but the damage had been done: the inconsistency in educational and employment policy would later form the basis of arguments in favor of Hindi.

In 1882, the British government formed a committee under Sir William Hunter to review the progress of education in India. There was mass mobilization of supporters of Hindi and of Urdu, and the usual arguments of each camp were made. 

In the end, though, Sir Syed Ahmad Khan, a high-ranking member of the Viceroy of India’s Legislative Council, argued that the debate between Hindi and Urdu was entirely political and had nothing to do with education. This put an end to the committee, and the Hindi supporters got the message: the British weren’t going to listen. One Hindi newspaper in Benares warned: “If the Government does not listen we must cry out so loudly that the sound reaches its ear.”[^104]

#### MacDonnell’s Order

Hindi supporters would have to wait a little while, but all hope was not lost.

In 1895, a prominent (at least to Hindi supporters) British advocate of Hindi, Sir Anthony MacDonnell, was appointed Lieutenant Governor of the NWP&O. This set off a massive revival of Hindi mobilization.

On Thursday, 2 March 1898 at noon, Madan Mohan Malaviya, editor of a Hindi nationalist weekly publication and and future president of the HSS, brought a delegation of 17 prominent citizens to a meeting with MacDonnell at the Government House in Allahabad. 

Malaviya presented a memorandum he had written called *Court Character and Primary Education in NWP&O*, which provided a history of the Hindi-Urdu controversy as well as arguments in favor of Nagari in a presentation filled with statistics and documentation. 

The main argument was the inconsistency between British educational policy which favored Hindi and British employment policy, which favored Urdu. Malaviya argued that this inconsistency should be resolved in the favor of Hindi.

To be clear, Malaviya did not want it to be resolved in favor of *highly-Sanskritized* Hindi – he wanted to raise the Hindi *spoken by the people* (that is, Hindustani) to a higher level to improve education in the whole province. He even cited the events of 1857-8 as a result of lack of education.

MacDonnell liked the arguments, but he was quick to warn against antagonizing the establishment, who would be sure to rise to defend the status quo.[^105] He knew that there was no easy solution to this issue, and in the end sided with Malaviya. On 18 April 1900, MacDonnell initiated an order for the Nagari script to be used in NWP&O, and on 26 June 1900 it was officially promulgated.[^106]

There was one hitch that came up: MacDonnell’s original order *only* had to do with the question of script. The order had said that when hiring, candidates would need to be able to *read* both the Nagari and Perso-Arabic scripts fluently. But during the process of ratification, the order was modified to state that candidates would need to be able to *speak* the Hindi and Urdu *languages* fluently.[^107]

Predictably, this decision was praised by supporters of Hindi and vehemently criticized as too sympathetic to the Hindi cause by supporters of Urdu. The Punjab Observer, an Urdu periodical, wrote on 4 July 1900: 

>We cannot but characterize [MacDonnell’s order] as anything short of a grave political blunder, and history written a hundred years later will have to mourn the mistake made in 1900.[^108]

Urdu opposition to the decree did not last long, however. The Muslim elite quickly backed off the issue when MacDonnell began to apply some pressure.  After all, they were ever more worried about maintaining their dwindling political power, which was entirely dependent upon maintaining cordial relations with the British.[^109]

This development was huge. **For the first time ever, the idea of Hindi and Urdu as distinct languages was given official, government endorsement**.

[^85]: When the Indian scholar, linguist, and historian Raja Sivaprasad petitioned the British on behalf of the Nagari script in 1868, he made sure to tell them that he was speaking on behalf of the Hindu middle class, who would be happy to accept to British rule. This sycophancy towards the British was of course accompanied by a complete denigration of the image of Muslims (Rai 2001: 35).

[^86]: Rai 2001: 37.

[^87]: King 1992: 183.

[^88]: In fact, they had originally wanted to publish in Sanskrit – they were all certainly proficient enough in it to do so – but were persuaded to write in Hindi. Unsurprisingly, their Hindi was full of Sanskrit influences.

[^89]: Rai 2001: 67.

[^90]: Rai 2001: 54.

[^91]: George Abraham Grierson, an administrator and linguist in India who wrote the monumental *Linguistic Survey of India*, commented that "these fanatics have confused alphabet with language. They say because a thing is written in  Deva-nagari [sic] therefore it is Hindi, the language of the Hindus, and because a thing is written in the Persian character therefore it is Urdu, the language of the Musalmans" (Grierson 1903-1928: Vol. IX, part 1, xiv).

[^92]: Thus in Bihar, the government officially implemented it, and it found great success. In 1881 began to be used in schools, and Kaithi texts began to appear more frequently. The move had its fair share of criticism; one Bengali educator, Dr. Rajendralal Mirtra, argued that using the script would disadvantage Biharis in the long-term, not only in that they would not have access to ancient and modern literature written in UP, but also economically (King 1992: 193).

[^93]: For example, that the Kaithi script was illegible and just as ambiguous as the Perso-Arabic script (which, as an abjad, does not typically mark vowels). These factors, some argued, made it unsuitable as a medium of education (King 1992: 193).
The Devanagari – Kaithi debate was in reality one of caste politics: Kaithi was a form of Kayasthi, the script of the Kayastha cast, whereas Devanagari was based on the Nagari script of the Brahmin caste. In fact, Devanagari was also known by another name: Babhni, or the script of the Brahmins.

[^94]: Rai 2001: 52.

[^95]: Another writer, Shridhar Pathak, who was highly-respected for his poetry in both Hindustani and Braj, advocated for Hindustani and wrote its first major poem in 1886. Like Khattri, he saw Braj and Hindustani as two different language. To him, Hindustan had a much brighter future ahead of it, as more people understood it. He also thought that Hindi should have *one* language for its prose and poetry (King 1992: 189).

[^96]: Rai 2001: 85.

[^97]: Rai 2001: 84.

[^98]: Braj poetic tradition was in some ways the foundation of Hindi identity in that it provided a rival to the appeal of Islam, and they were not about to give that up to a dialect they perceived as being so close to Urdu (Rai 2001: 88).

[^99]: For example, Radha Charan Goswami, editor of a Hindi newspaper in Brindaban in the heart of the Braj area, criticized Hindustani, writing that it and Braj were the same language, and that nothing of any substance had ever been written in it. Furthermore, if Hindustani were to be accepted as the literary language of Hindi poetry, it would only help spread Urdu’s influence.

[^100]: 20 years later, in 1910, the first HSS convened in Benares to debate not *whether* Braj should be the literary language of poetry, but rather to what extent they should hold on to what was left of it. A complete reversal had occurred, with harsh condemnations of Braj as the enemy of Hindi (King 1992: 191).

[^101]: Interestingly, Prasad was not actually opposed to Persianized Urdu words in principle, just to the use of the Perso-Arabic script (Rai 2001: 39). King (1992: 188) also quotes one professor, Raj Kumar Sarvadhikari, commenting in 1882 that “Urdu is the dialect of the Muhammadan inhabitants and Hindi of the Hindus.”

[^102]: Rai 2001: 39.

[^103]: The incoherence was at least in part due to the 1813 Charter Act, which had established that the British East India Company would be responsible for educating Indians, but their objectives were vague at best and there was little planning of policies (Das Gupta 1970: 41).

[^104]: Rai 2001: 42.

[^105]: Thus, for example, the Secretary of NWP&O wrote to the Chief Commissioner in Oudh in 1871 that it would be politically dangerous for the government to support Hindi over Urdu (Rai 2001: 44).

[^106]: Rai 2001: 45.

[^107]: It is entirely possible, and even likely, that MacDonnell was in favor of this modification, which was called a mistake in the press. In the wake of riots in Kanpur which were the result of successful inter-community cooperation and coordination, the *Times of India* reported on 5 June 1900 that MacDonnell’s (original) order had been intended in large part to prevent the possibility of such future cooperation between different communities against the British. The 14 June 1900 *Pall Mall Gazette* even cites a wire from MacDonnell himself to support this (Rai 2001: 48).

[^108]: Quoted in Rai (2001: 46).

[^109]: Rai (2001:47) provides the example of MacDonnell providing an ultimatum to Mohsin-ul-Mulk, an “Aligarh bigwig”: either he could remain the Secretary of the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College, or he could oppose MacDonnell. Mohsin-ul-Mulk backed down.

# Hindi and Urdu: A Story of Names
**Untangling the complicated history of two of India’s biggest languages.**


It was 1847, and the students of Dr. John R. Ballantyne, the Scottish superintendent of Government Sanskrit College in Benares, had been struggling to improve the style of their Hindi. One day, Dr. Ballantyne finally snapped, and asked them to write an essay on the following topic: 

> “Why do you despise the culture of the language you speak every day of your lives, of the only language which your mothers and sisters understand?”

To which one student replied:

>"We do not clearly understand what you Europeans mean by the term Hindi, for there are hundreds of dialects, all in our opinion equally entitled to the name, and there is here no standard as there is in Sanskrit.[^1]"

It wouldn’t be long, though, before the conception of Hindi had become a lot clearer. Today, there can be no doubt about the status of Hindi [in India]( https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/Govt-to-promote-use-of-Hindi-in-routine-conversation-NE/articleshow/52659063.cms) and even in [the world](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/prime-minister-narendra-modi-to-address-un-general-assembly-in-hindi-rajnath-singh/article6409820.ece). [All sorts of stories](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/stories-they-tell-about-languages/article4747023.ece) have become a part of the mystique of Hindi. Languages older than Hindi are now considered by many to be dialects of it, poets once rejected are now praised.

And how did Urdu fit into all of this? The story of Hindi and Urdu is a tightly woven one, one surrounded by hopes, fears, political interests, mythologies, revised histories, and (oftentimes violent) conflict. 

The popular understanding of the situation now is that Hindi and Urdu are two distinct languages. But has that always been the case? In a country with [22 officially-recognized languages]( https://mha.gov.in/sites/default/files/Eighth_Schedule.pdf), why has the conflict between Hindi and Urdu in particular been so intense, so highly politicized?

Our journey will take us from the early days of the ancestors of Hindi and Urdu through the reign of the Mughal Empire and past the 1947 Partition of India to Hindi and Urdu today. We’ll see just what the role of Ballantyne and Government Sanskrit College in Benares was, how dialects and languages rose and fell, and how closely-related language and identity truly are. 

## The Early Days: Old and Middle Indo-Aryan[^2]
### The Rise of Sanskrit

Around 4,000 years ago, a group of Indo-Europeans nomads made their way into India. They called themselves *Ārya*, which likely meant “noble, honorable”, and their new land *Āryāvarta* “land of the noble”. They had made their way to the Indian subcontinent from the northwest and spoke an early language from the Indo-Aryan (IA) branch of the Indo-European language family.[^3]

Our earliest evidence of IA languages – and possibly of any Indo-European language, for that matter – is the *Rigveda*. This was one of four Vedas, the oldest and most sacred Hindu texts, which had been painstakingly preserved over the centuries from generation to generation – amazingly, they were passed down orally, and not through manuscripts. In fact, the texts that we have are fairly accurate, given that the Vedas originated somewhere around 1500 – 1200 BCE, centuries before Homer’s *Iliad* and *Odyssey*.[^4]

The language of all of the Vedas was **Sanskrit**, and as the language of the Hindu sacred texts, it had an unparalleled prestige among languages of the area – the very name “Sanskrit” comes from Sanskrit:  *sáṃskṛta* means “well-prepared, pure and perfect”.  It had the ultimate level of prestige, really – the Vedas were considered to have divine origin, and the language used to express them was perfect and sacred.

As an Indo-European language, Sanskrit shared many features with languages as distant as Latin or Ancient Greek,[^5] as well as even modern languages like English or French, but it was more closely related to the Indo-Iranian Persian language and even more closely related to the modern languages of India today, such as Hindi, Urdu, Punjabi, Bengali, and others.

### Out with the old, in with the middle

This sacred Sanskrit language eventually began to change, though, as any spoken language is bound to. This change was perceived as a threat to the Vedas, and it was the role of the some of the world’s first linguists to stop the change. Grammarians such as Panini, who wrote down almost 4,000 grammar rules of Sanskrit around 400 BCE,[^6] helped crystallize what is now known as [“Classical Sanskrit”](https://lrc.la.utexas.edu/eieol/vedol).[^7] Classical Sanskrit would go on to play an unimaginably influential role in the development of the IA languages.

At any rate, despite the grammarians’ best efforts at freezing Sanskrit, they only partially succeeded. They had frozen *written* Sanskrit, but the spoken language continued to change.

With the rise of two new religions, Buddhism and Jainism, around the 5th century BCE, new language varieties came into play. The followers of these new religions questioned the authority of the Vedas, and what better way to do that than to reject the prestige of Sanskrit? 

The early texts of Buddhism and Jainism, unsurprisingly, are thus written in other, non-Sanskrit varieties of what are called the Middle IA languages, to distinguish them from the Old IA languages such as Sanskrit.8 These languages came from the east, and as they spread west they formed a sort of *lingua franca* known as Pali.[^8]

Pali’s prestige was certainly helped by the fact that it was used in the texts of Theravada Buddhism, the most ancient school of Buddhism that still exists today. On top of this, the Mauryan Emperor Ashoka helped spread Pali far and wide as a *koine*, or common language between dialects, around 250 BCE by putting up inscriptions on pillars across India.[^10]

But again, as time passed, one language made way for another, and Pali was eventually replaced by what is known as Prakrit. We know about this language mostly through dramas, as well as the religious writings of the Jains.

Around the 6th century CE, Prakrit was slowly replaced by a new type of Prakrit language known as Apabhramsha – the new *lingua franca*. This language developed a rich literature across North India, and by the 12th century there were a number of varieties in use. 

One variety of Apabhramsha in particular, though, known as **Saurseni Apabhramsha**, was especially important: **it would end up being the mother of what are now called the Western Hindi languages, which include Hindi and Urdu.** 

## The Muslim Influence
### The Delhi Sultanate

Just after 1100, Mahmud of Ghazni, Sultan of the Ghaznavid Empire and first sovereign ruler to be known as sultan, conquered the Punjab region in the northwest part of India. The Ghaznavid Empire was a Muslim dynasty with Turkic origins, and they had a highly “Persianized” society. Though Turkish literary culture did persist for a while, the Ghaznavid court operated in Persian, and [Persian was the language of all things cultural]( http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ghaznavids). 

With the conquest of Delhi in 1192, the Delhi Sultanate came into being, and after that, Muslim rule expanded east at an astonishing rate. By the 14th century, the Delhi Sultanate controlled most of India, apart from some isolated areas such as Rajasthan and the extreme south.[^11]

**This was the start of a long period of Muslim political dominance, which would have significant impacts on the development of India. And those influences would be felt perhaps nowhere more than in the use of languages.**

#### Khari Boli and Persian

Let’s take a closer look at the Persian that the elite of the Delhi Sultanate were speaking.

The Persian that was brought into (especially North) India was special. Originally, with the rapid expansion of Islam in the 7th century CE, communities that adopted the religion also adopted the Arabic language due to the religious significance of the Quran being written in it. 

In eastern Iran and Central Asia, though, Arabic just didn’t quite stick the way it had in the Middle East and North Africa. Instead, Persians began using the Arabic script (with some modifications) and adopted an absolutely vast quantity of Arabic loan words, foreign sounds and all (bearing in mind that Arabic is entirely unrelated to Persian and Indo-European languages in general).[^12]

The political domination of the Delhi Sultanate in North India spread both Islam and this Arabicized Persian across India. It was patronized lavishly by the political elite, and all high-prestige literature, education, and administration was conducted in it.[^13] 

But the spoken language was a different story. 

The spoken language of Delhi was not so much one dialect as it was a mixture of many. Several Indian languages including (but not limited to) Braj, Haryanvi, Punjabi, and Rajasthani all played a role in the creation of Khari Boli, the speech of Delhi.[^14] And it wasn’t just Indian languages in the mix. Language contact between Persian and Arabic speakers and Khari Boli speakers also resulted in many new sounds and a healthy dose of Persian and Arabic loan words.[^15]

Now, although the Indian languages are related to Persian (both are Indo-Iranian languages), they are not mutually intelligible.  For all its prestige and use among the elite and in the courts, Persian (for the most part) just couldn’t compete with the widespread use of Khari Boli. Khari Boli was spoken[^16] across the northern region of India, from Fatehgarh Sahib in the far northwest to what constitutes modern-day Uttar Pradesh (UP) in the north.[^17]

Khari Boli, now in stable shape in the capital, became the *lingua franca* of the north – and over time, more and more of India – and would go on to provide the basis for Hindi, Urdu, and Hindustani.

For the sake of using a name with a clear connection to its continued use as the *lingua franca* of much of India (or, earlier, “Hindustan”), we will refer to Khari Boli as **Hindustani**.[^18]

This also helps with precision. Speakers of just about any Indian language across the continent referred to their own language as “Hindi”, whether it be the Khari Boli dialect of any other. This was a legacy of the Muslims, who had used the words *hindī* “Indian language” and *hindvī* “Hindi language” to describe just about any Indian language – they were fairly indifferent about the whole issue.[^19]

Hindustani was by no means the only language spoken by people in India, of course. The 12th century saw a number of Indo-Aryan dialects splitting off from the different Apabhramshas and flourishing in their own rights. In the west, there was Rajasthani and Gujarati; in the south Marathi; in the east, Maithili and Bhojpuri; and further east Bengali, Assamese, and Oriya.

Likewise, Persian was by no means the only literary language with any prestige. Rajasthani, for example, found favor among the smaller Rajput courts of north, west, and central India. In addition, in and around Lucknow, Muslim rulers also patronized an Eastern Hindi language known as Avadhi. This led to the development of a major tradition of Sufi (Islam) verse.[^20]

#### Planting the seeds of Urdu literary tradition

Literary language or not, Hindustani would soon be spread across India over the course of the Delhi Sultanate’s rule (1211 – 1504). Muslim armies conquered the subcontinent and populations moved to fill up the conquered lands and brought Hindustani with them.

Two of the Sultanate’s expansions are especially relevant to the development of Hindustani. Even though it would be quite a while before the name Urdu caught on among speakers, it is nevertheless clear that expansion southwards was the beginning of the literary tradition of what is now called Urdu.

The first was expansion south into Gujarat. In 1297, Alauddin Khalji (ruled 1296 – 1316), annexed Gujarat into the Delhi Sultanate. This would initiate a large movement of people that would only increase after Timur, the first ruler of the Timurid dynasty of Central Asia, sacked Delhi in 1398. 

By the early 15th century, Hindustani had become so popular in Gujarat that *it even began to influence Persian*. In this region, the local names for the language were abandoned in favor of Gujri, though “Hindi” continued to be used alongside it.[^21]

The Sufis developed Gujri into a literary language, and as Muslims, they wrote in the Perso-Arabic script. The development of Gujri as a literary language defined what could be called “the parameters of Urdu language and literature” – the language, the form, the themes, and so on. 

**In other words, the literary tradition established in Gujarat can be considered one part of Urdu’s earliest literary tradition**.[^22]

The second expansion was into the Deccan, the large plateau rising up from southern and western India. Right on the heels of their Gujarati counterparts, the Sufis in the Deccan would lead the charge in creating another early variety of Urdu.

Most of the expansion came during the rule of Sultan Muhammad bin Tughlaq (ruled 1325 – 1351), when there was a large migration of the population from Delhi to Daulatabad and Aurangabad in the Deccan. Sometimes these migrations were voluntary, such as Hindu merchants and Sufi mystics and preachers who moved south for business or to establish new religious centers. But sometimes they were not quite as voluntary – in 1327, Sultan Tughlaq moved the capital from Delhi to and forcibly brought the population, and so Hindustani as well, with him.[^23]

Persian was virtually unknown in the south at this time, and the Sufis who wanted to spread their message decided to use the Hindustani they had brought from the north. As they brought Hindustani south, it picked up some Punjabi features, as well as influences from the local dialects of the Deccan along the way. 

The final result was a variety of Hindustani spoken in the Deccan that was full of *tadbhava*, “indigenous words” – words that with their origins in Middle IA rather than foreign languages – with a sprinkling of Persian or Arabic words. Over time, the number of words borrowed from Persian and Arabic increased.[^24]

This variety came to be known as *Dakhanī* (lit., “southern”), *Hindwī*, or *Dehlavī*, and was written in the Perso-Arabic script, a decision which would have important consequences later on. 

Once established, Dakhani would explode in popularity in southern India over the course of the next two centuries.[^25] Rulers of many of the Muslim kingdoms, notably in Bijapur and Golkunda (modern-day Hyderabad), began patronizing it. By the 17th century, Dakhani had established a rich literature for itself in a wide variety of genres. 

**This was the other founding moment of Urdu literary tradition.**

### Enter Mughals

The Delhi Sultanate would not last forever, and it was eventually defeated by the Mughal Empire in 1526. The Mughals had roots in the Timurid dynasty of Central Asia but were heavily steeped in Indo-Persian culture. This meant that Persian was the official language of the court, and that it was spoken and written by the Mughal elites and nobles, at least in official (or high-cultural) contexts.[^26]

#### The Situation in North India

From the late 15th century on, and especially beginning in the reign of Emperor Akbar from 1556 – 1605, the Mughal government patronized the western language *Braj Bhāsā* as well as the eastern language Avadhi. These languages were patronized alongside Persian by both Hindus and Muslims, and a rich (and mostly religious) literary tradition developed around them. 

Braj in particular became nearly as prestigious as a literary language as Persian,[^27] and even Emperor Akbar himself tried his hand at it.[^28]

And just to confuse things, it was also around this time that **in North India, the term “Hindi” came to refer specifically to Braj.**[^29]

But what about the spoken language in the north?

Continued military presence in an area is not self-sustaining. It needs someone to run it, and it needs resources. In this way, the Persian-speaking administrative and commercial aspects of the Muslim rulers had a huge impact. The result was that up to the 17th century, even though Hindustani was the main vernacular, Persian was at the very least understood by much of the north Indian urban population.[^30]

That Persian was so widely-understood in the North had serious consequences in its own right. To take one example, it meant that contrary to in the south, the Sufis of the north were perfectly comfortable in Persian and saw no reason to use Hindustani at all. 

In the late 17th century, the Delhi elite, in love with all things Persian, began patronizing what was known as Rekhtah, in a conscious attempt to write in a Persianized Hindustani. Rekhtah, which meant “mixed” in Persian,[^31] was a form of poetry written in a mixture of Hindustani and Persian inside of a Persian poetic template.[^32] This can be considered the earliest form of the early Urdu variety of Hindustani, or Urdu-Hindustani.

This was also the earliest stage of the “Muslimization” of Urdu, as the Muslim elite patronized it heavily. This patronage would ultimately be the driving force behind the rise of Urdu.[^33]

In the south, things were quite the opposite: though Rekhtah had made its way there, it would never reach anywhere near the same levels of popularity as it did in the north, given the massive popularity of Gujri and Dakhani.[^34]

Before we move on, it is worth taking a moment to consider why Dakhani became a prestigious literary language, flourishing among these southern Muslim kingdoms of the Deccan, all the while in North India Hindustani was seen as such a low language, undeserving of cultivation.

For Dakhani in the south, one of the major force driving forces was cultural identity. Language is a powerful way of drawing the boundaries of an identity. So, in response to increasing pressure from the Mughal Empire, which was on its way to conquering the entire Indian subcontinent, **the Muslim kingdoms used language – Dakhani in particular – to assert an identity distinct from the Persian-speaking Mughals.**

In the north, Hindustani was the *lingua franca*, and in fact a highly successful one at that.

But the attitudes of the elite towards Hindustani were generally negative. Hindustani was seen as little more than a “mongrel *patois*” that was only necessary for communication between the indigenous population and the foreign rulers.[^35] Neither Muslims nor Hindus in North India had any real desire to turn it into a literary language.[^36] This meant that there just had not been the same opportunities for Hindustani to establish a literary tradition as there had been in the south, and so development of the literary tradition was significantly slowed down. One way or another, Delhi literary circles were biased against Dakhani – against anything non-Delhi, really.

#### Vali visits Delhi

In 1657, Emperor Aurangzeb seized the Mughal throne. He immediately set to work on conquering the Deccan kingdoms, and the rest of the southern Muslim kingdoms quickly fell under Mughal control. Breaking up the kingdoms during the conquests meant that the royal courts were dissolved, which had the side effect of scattering the artists and poets of those courts far and wide.[^37]

Some of the poets displaced by Aurangzeb’s conquests ended up going back north. This meant that the north would finally be exposed to the Dakhani variety of Hindustani. It would have to compete with Braj, Avadhi, and Persian, of course, which would be no mean feat.[^38]

One of the poets who moved north was Wali (1667 – 1707/8), born in Aurangabad.[^39] Even before arriving in Delhi around 1700, Wali was already an established poet in the south. Once in Delhi, he revolutionized the field. **He showed the elite of North India once and for all that Hindustani was capable of poetry just as good as any Indo-Persian poetry.**[^40]

On the whole, he was well-received by the *literati* of Delhi. However, there was still a general feeling of uncertainty, given that Wali was an outsider, and a Dakhani outsider at that.

But their ambivalence could not have been due to the actual language he was using. Wali’s poetry was not pure Dakhani, but rather more like Rekhtah influenced by Dakhani and Gujri. In fact, whatever Dakhani influences that could be seen were almost entirely limited to *tadbhav* - the indigenous words the elite later worked so hard to eliminate. But at the time of Wali’s visit most of these would not have been unfamiliar to speakers of the Delhi dialect.[^41]

No, the real problem was that Wali was not himself from Delhi. All non-Delhi speech – even if an elite was speaking it – was looked down on.[^42] Admitting that Wali had revolutionized poetry would be an admission that a non-Delhi poet had come in and, rather than learning from the Delhi poets, had actually taught *them* something. 

The Delhi elite quickly took up arms. Later leading poets such as Mir (1722 – 1810) and Qayem Chandpuri (1724/25 – 1794) took the lead in trying to diminish his achievements.[^43]  After all, if they could show that Wali’s poetry wasn’t actually influenced by Dakhani, but rather by Persian / Delhi poetry, it would certainly fit their story of the supremacy of Delhi poetry a lot better.[^44]

#### From Hindustani to Urdu

And so they began a “purification” of Hindustani. Contemporary influential poets such as Arzu (1689- 1756), Shah Hatim (1699 – 1781) and Jan-e-Janaan (1699 – 1781) worked to remove both Braj words and obviously indigenous words. After all, “correct” Hindustani couldn’t just be the language of the masses. No, “correct” Hindustani was the “elevated”, Persian-influenced kind spoken in the court.[^45]

It was this language that the elite considered their own, and which they wanted to give the status of Persian. This meant replacing Persian as the language of the royal city – the *zabān-e urdū-e mu’allā*.[^46]

Even the Emperor was speaking the Persianized Hindustani. In January 1772, the sixteenth Mughal Emperor, Shah Alam II, moved back to Delhi and took up residence at the Red Fort. Shah Alam was an avid lover of languages. He patronized both Sanskrit as well as Hindustani, which, due in large part to years in Allahabad, he spoke in informal situations. He even tried his hand at writing something more substantial in it (although he identifies the language he was writing in as “Hindi”, of course). By speaking Hindustani, Shah Alam raised its prestige significantly. 

This Persianized Hindustani’s prestige grew enough that the *zabān-e urdū-e mu’allā* began shifting towards it and away from Persian. It was *this* specific variety carved out by the Delhi elite that would go on to be called **Urdu**, shortened from * zabān-e urdū-e mu’allā*, and which was supposedly distinct from the Hindustani of the masses.[^47] (From now on, we’ll refer to that Persianized Hindustani by the name Urdu as well.)  

In this way, the Mughals played a key role in the spread of Urdu. Wherever their power extended, so too did Urdu.[^48]

## The Hindi-Urdu Split
### A convenient fiction

Up until this point in history, all invasions of India had come from Central Asia in the northwest. The strategy of naval assaults utilized by the British East India Company was not successful in the beginning. It was only after they established the trading port of Calcutta at the end of the 17th century – which became their capital and remained so until 1912 – that they began making any sort of real territorial gains in the Indian subcontinent.[^49]

After their decisive victories in the Battle of Plassey in 1757 and the Battle of Buxar in 1764, which had resulted in a decapitated Mughal Empire, the British had almost complete power over Bengal. But they did assume direct control. What the British did instead was submit – ostensibly, at least – to the authority of the Mughals by assuming the role of *dīvānī*, or chief official, rather than overlord. 

**This was a “convenient fiction”**: all power rested with the East India Company, who was in reality using the Mughals to administer their newly-conquered territories for them. The British slowly extended their control over North India under the guise of Mughal administration, and continued to do so until the 19th century.[^50]

Linguistically speaking, this had one important effect: The switch from Persian to English and local languages as the language of administration was stretched out a lot longer than it would have been, had the British assumed direct control immediately. 

### Meanwhile, at Fort William College…

For the British, the linguistic situation before and leading up to the 19th century was at best confused. New laws were drafted in English, but the British required their officials to speak with their Bengali subjects in Persian. In fact, the British had to rely on interpreters for over a century and half of their rule.

The only awareness of Hindustani the British had was that it was some “jargon associated with Muslims” that was “useful for giving orders to soldiers and servants.”[^51] Though they identified it as a largely Muslim language, they *were* aware that it was spoken or at least understood by a large number of people across India.[^52]

The British were well aware that the linguistic incoherence of their policies was taking a toll on the efficiency of their colonial administration. 

And thus was Fort William College in Calcutta born on 4 May 1800. The idea was to teach young British officials the various Indian languages necessary for administration of their empire. Languages included Hindustani, Arabic, Persian, Sanskrit, and provincial languages like Bengali or Braj.[^53]

#### The Story of John Borthwick Gilchrist

In 1782, a Scottish physician and part-time indigo planter by the name of John Borthwick Gilchrist (1759 – 1841) arrived in Bombay. He took an immediate liking to Hindustani – not the highly-Persianized Hindustani, but the Hindustani that was the language of the people, the one that was based on all those western dialects (but which did still have some borrowing from other languages including Persian and  Arabic). He realized that it was not just some jargon useful for giving orders but actually, as he described it, a “grand, popular and military language of all India.”[^54]

This contrasted with what Urdu (that is, Persianized Hindustani) had become: a language far removed from everyday Indian life, a language full of foreign words, written in a hard-to-learn script that hadn’t even been designed for an Indo-Aryan language in the first place.[^55]

Gilchrist, ever the entrepreneur, saw an opening.

Gilchrist decided that was really needed was a dictionary and a grammar of Hindustani. Needed not by the Indian population, of course, but by the Europeans in India. After all, how could proper colonial administration proceed smoothly when the British had to navigate a sea of widely different languages, dialects, accents, vocabularies, and so on, all of which the native Indians navigated with ease?

During the process of compiling the dictionary, Gilchrist made use of a distinctly European framework for understanding languages. That is to say, that were tacit ideological commitments underpinning Gilchrist’s work that the native Hindustani speakers did not share.

Gilchrist himself discusses situations that he found himself in that really highlight the different between his conceptions about language and those of the Indians.

One was actually a recurring problem that Gilchrist faced while making the dictionary. The original plan was to fill the dictionary with references to literature to illustrate a word’s usage. However, whenever he would ask one of his Hindustani-speaking employees for references, they often provided references in languages Gilchrist considered beyond the boundaries of Hindustani, but which were to them perfectly reasonable responses.[^56]

The other was a humorous exchange that occurred between Gilchrist and the educated Hindustani speakers he had hired to help him with the dictionary.

One of Gilchrist’s first steps in his project was to ask the Hindustani speakers if there was any existing dictionary of Hindustani. They looked at him in complete astonishment and asked him “if it was yet ever known in any country, that men had to consult vocabularies, and rudiments for their own vernacular speech.”[^57] To them, the idea of a monolingual dictionary – an idea absolutely fundamental to the  European understanding of a standard language – was unthinkable.

Cultural differences or not, Gilchrist powered through. A few months of painstaking work later, the dictionary was ready.[^58]

Gilchrist’s work got him appointed Professor of Hindustani at Fort William College in 1800. It was time to put his work into use. Over the next four years, Gilchrist brought together a staff of educated Indians. The goal of his department was to develop a Hindustani *prose* style.

And they were successful: many of the language textbooks created to teach British officers local languages became quite famous, especially the ones for Hindustani (that is, Persianized Hindustnai, or Urdu) prose.[^59] All in all, up to 60 instructional books were published for the British servants and officers who needed to learn Hindustani. Script just was not a central issue yet,[^60] and so some were printed in the Perso-Arabic script, some in the Nagari script.[^61]

But the defining moment in the development of Hindi would come just a few years later. 

Originally, Gilchrist had no intention of “purifying” Hindustani in any way. All he wanted to do was firmly establish its boundaries and separate it from the languages of the elites, priests and aristocrats, such as Persian and Sanskrit. In other words, he wanted to figure out **exactly what counted as Hindustani**. 

This was a major ideological difference between Gilchrist and the Indians. **Where Gilchrist saw numerous, distinct languages, each the possible object of study – and standardization – the Indian population saw a broad spectrum dialects related to various degrees, each of which could seamlessly lend to and borrow from other dialects.**

But Gilchrist’s love for Hindustani that eventually led him to worry that it would become tarnished by the presence of too many Persian and Arabic loanwords. He had three of the Indians working for him – the leading poets and authors Insha’llah Khan, Sadal Misra, and Lalu Lal – take the ordinary, mixed Hindustani and remove the Persian and Arabic loans to create a language more suitable for the Hindu population.[^62]

One work in particular, the *Ocean of Love* (*Prem sāgar*) by Lalu Lal, changed everything. It was essentially written in Urdu, but the Persian words had been replaced by Indo-Aryan words. Up to this point, there had been no such thing as “Hindi literature.” This was the dawn of Modern Hindi.[^64]

But the success would not last. This new “Hindi” language would soon fall off the radar, only to be revived later on after the Indian Rebellion of 1857 against the British.

So in a sense, Gilchrist was doubly successful in his goal to develop Hindustani prose. That is, *two* literary standards had been developed: Hindi, purged of Persian words, and Urdu, a Persianized style.[^64]

#### The missionaries of Serampore

But Gilchrist wasn’t the only force driving the standardization of the *literary* variety of Hindustani that would come to be known as Hindi.

At the end of the 18th century, about the same time as Gilchrist was active, missionaries set up shop in Serampore, near the British India capital of Calcutta. In the eyes of the missionaries, they had arrived in a world of chaos, and they had to create order out of it. Their mission – converting the Indians to Christianity – would end up having a sort of “normalizing” effect on the nascent Hindi literary language.

Take, for example, the importance of the new printing technologies of the day. Not long after arriving in Serampore, the missionaries established what were known as “School Book” societies and were publishing books left and right. But this meant at the very least developing a typeface for Hindi, but typically also meant standardizing the grammar, spelling, and so on.[^65]

There was another factor that led to more standardization efforts. Outside of the missionaries’ view of India, the idea of separate Hindu and Muslim communities just did not really exist yet.[^66] This is not to say that no one was aware of religious differences. Rather, it just means that at the time, religious affiliation was less important in determining one’s cultural identity than other factors. 

The missionaries, however, were prone to privileging religious categories over any other categories. They tried to appeal to the Indians of North India with two variants of the same Hindustani language: one for the Hindus, with all the Perso-Arabic words removed and substituted with Sanskrit words, and one for the Muslims, full of Perso-Arabic borrowings. Ironically, the missionaries’ attempts to turn Indians into “Christians” actually contributed to the development of separate “Hindu” and “Muslim” identities.[^67]

#### Early reactions to Hindi

It was certainly not clear that the missionaries in Serampore or the professors of Fort William College had any active desire to cause issues – or were even aware of the potential consequences of their actions – when they began standardizing Hindi and other local dialects. There were practical considerations at play, of course, such as how the British needed to run their colonial administration and train officers and servants, and in their view, doing so would be impossible in the highly mixed linguistic context of India. The development of Hindi was one result of their desire to apply their linguistic framework to Indian languages.

But how did the Hindu population, who Hindi was supposedly being developed for, feel about it?

The answer: It was not clear that they wanted it at all. After all, they had the Delhi literary tradition of Hindustani (that is, Urdu), so why did they need a new one? Though the Muslim community felt an increasing affinity with Urdu, the language was still spoken by an immense number of people, Muslim or otherwise. Through the 18th century, Urdu was the *lingua franca* of both Hindus and Muslims.[^68]

One point of criticism was actually that supporters of Hindi, both British and Indian, were trying far too hard to Sanskritize Hindustani and create a Hindu-specific variety of Hindustani. 

Sanskrit scholars, who presumably would have some thoughts on this process of Sanskritization, saw no necessary connection between being Hindu and speaking “Hindi.” In fact, one argument was that this Sanskritization was actually the result of the cultural domination of Sanskritized *Bangla* - the language of Bengal – rather than any direct Sanskrit influence.[^69]

Finally, there was the simple point that the term “Hindi” was vague and ambiguous, given that since the time of the first Persian conquests of India it had been used to refer to any spoken language, and people would likely continue to use it to identify their local dialect.[^70]

### A new look for Urdu

Now, when the British finally did make the switch from Persian to *local* languages, it was not a uniform process. Newly-published grammars and dictionaries of local languages such as Punjabi, Sindhi, or Burmese had made it possible for them to replace Persian with those languages (which they had standardized) in different provinces. Perhaps more importantly for the British, it allowed them to create an index of official terminology and translations into English – the ultimate language of authority.

There were some easier cases for them: in the south, namely Bombay and the Madras Presidencies, they replaced Persian with Tamil in 1832.  In Bengal, they had recourse to the standardized Bengali language, though it would take them until 1837 to make the switch.[^71]

The reason they wanted to switch from Persian to local languages was purely practical. There was a persistent problem in their colonial administration: the people going to the courts to work out their problems were rarely proficient in Persian. This did not make for efficient governance. The British wanted to make court proceedings more easily understood by those people, and so they had two choices: get everyone to learn Persian, or just change the language of the courts to the local languages.[^72]

But some cases were not so easy: What would the British do in the North-West Provinces? 

Colloquial Hindustani varied considerably across India – unsurprising given the geographical size and linguistic diversity of the area in which it was spoken. This would not work for the British – it didn’t fit in neatly with their goal of categorizing and standardizing languages to make them more suitable for their colonial administration needs. 

And so in 1837, the British chose not the colloquial Hindustani of the people, but the Persianized version of the Delhi elite. Because of this, Hindustani and Urdu came to be essentially equivalent to the British,[^73] even though there was an ever-widening gap between the colloquial Hindustani of the people and Urdu of the elites, which featured a “largely Perso-Arabic vocabulary.”[^74] 

The “largely Perso-Arabic vocabulary” quickly became an “excessively Perso-Arabic vocabulary” – so excessive that the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces (NWP) basically admitted that this official Urdu was little different from Persian.[^75] 

The irony of this decision was not lost on anyone: the official, excessively-Persianized Urdu had been chosen *specifically to make things easier for the people,* but few people had any experience with it at all, written or spoken. In fact, complaints about the excessive Persianization of the courts continued well into the 20th century.

Ironic decision or not, **British support for Urdu would almost single-handedly assure its success and domination as a symbol of Indo-Persian culture.**[^76]

But there’s an important question we need to answer: *why was there the change of name from Hindustani to Urdu?*

At first, the British had actually preferred the name *Hindustani* for the common language of the people. Given that Hindustani was so widely-spoken as a *lingua franca* across India, it fit the usual pattern: England, English; France, French; Hindustan, Hindustani. Though the term had been in use among native speakers since as early as the 16th or 17th centuries, it was really never as popular as “Hindi” or even “Rekhtah”. 

The name Urdu, however, had several benefits. The obvious one was the clear etymological connection to Turkish – and so also to Muslims. The converse of this was that it had no clear connection to Hindus anymore, which made space for a name to designate whatever the language of the Hindus was.

As early as 1798 we find an educated native Urdu speaker referring to his own language – the language of Delhi – as Urdu. And this was free from considerations of British politics – the book was revised in 1815 in Lucknow, which was not under British control yet.[^77] This usage of Urdu fits in with the process we saw above, where *zabān-e urdū-e mu’allā-e shāhjahānābād*, which referred to the language of Delhi, eventually came to refer specifically to Hindustani rather than Persian. 

Non-Muslim native speakers of Urdu resisted the name for the exact reasons the British preferred it. In their view it was highly misleading to the origins and nature of the language, suggesting that it was a non-Indian, Muslim language. As late as 1858, many speakers of Urdu were unsure about the term.[^78]

One way or another, in the early 19th century, Urdu really had everything going for it. The Muslim population had been feeling increasingly distant from their Persian heritage, and Urdu’s connection to their classical past was the perfect way to compensate for this feeling. Urdu thus became more and more popular among the Muslim population – becoming the official language of a large part of North India certainly didn’t hurt. At a more personal level, Urdu had even replaced Persian as the default language of the Muslim community.[^79]

### A Turning Point

It is easy to place the blame for the Hindi-Urdu split entirely on the British, to get the (perhaps not incorrect) impression that had the British not colonized and brutally ruled over India, the split would not exist today.

But in an issue as complicated as the status of Hindi and Urdu, it is never that simple.

In fact, there is actually a good case to be made that the British *did not* want Hindi and Urdu to be considered separate languages. Yes, the work carried out at Fort William College had been one of the main contributing factors in the development of Hindi and Urdu as literary styles, but they were just that, and nothing more: *literary styles of the same language.*

This explains administrative documents related to how the British dealt with the Hindi-Urdu controversy. Among these documents are statements such as “it is desirable for the Government to guard most carefully against passing any orders that may countenance the idea that Hindi and Urdu are two distinct languages.” 

In other words, if anything, the British were committed to having one language *with different standards* that would just be enhanced by different influences such as Sanskrit, Persian, or Arabic.[^80]

The “impulse to divide” – that is, to consider Hindi and Urdu completely separate languages – “came from elsewhere”, as one scholar puts it. That is, the British were certainly a *necessary* condition for the split to happen, but they were not *sufficient* by themselves.[^81]

Let’s take a look at where that impulse to divide came from.

#### The Indian Rebellion of 1857

The British choosing Urdu as the official language of administration had been a major setback for Hindi. The British’s choice of Urdu made it clear that despite whatever efforts there had been towards developing a Hindi prose style, there was still really was just no accepted, modern style of Hindi which could have been promoted for use in essential administrative functions of the government. 

Hindi was in a tough spot. It did not have anywhere near the wide base of support that colloquial Hindustani had, and it did not have the official recognition that Urdu did.

**The Indian Rebellion of 1857 would be a turning point, the start of Hindi’s dramatic rise to prominence in India.**

In May 1857, in the town of Meerut to the northeast of Delhi, a band of sepoys – Indian soldiers of the British East India Company – rebelled against the rule of the East India Company. Mutinies erupted across central India and were taken extremely seriously by the British.

It took until 1858 for the British to suppress the rebellion. The end result of the Indian Rebellion was that the East India Company was dissolved, and the British assumed direct political control of India, establishing the British Raj. 

The suppression of the rebellion had immense consequences on the ideological frameworks at play in India. 

At the broadest level, the main issue for the Indians was, of course, that the British had won. The Hindi and Urdu elite developed different ways of explaining (and justifying) what had happened to them. In Urdu circles, there was a general sense of defeat, of having to accept the British colonialist view of Indians as degenerates. There was nostalgia for the golden days of Mughal power and elite Muslim aristocracy. 

Hindu elites had a similar general sense of defeat and acceptance of the British colonialist view. But there was one key difference: **The Hindu elite cited centuries of Muslim “tyranny” as the cause of the “Old” India’s problems and the subsequent repression of the rebellion**.[^82]

This gave Hindu ideologues a good explanation for the current state of affairs as well as the repressed memories of 1857-8. The Hindus could remove themselves from the defeat that had just occurred – in their view, everything that happened was because of the centuries of Muslim rule.[^83]

To the Hindus, the dark days of Muslim tyranny were waning, and the future was bright.

### The beginning of a rivalry

To put it simply, competition with Urdu – the dominant Indo-Persian culture of the 18th and 19th centuries[^84] – was far and away the most prominent influence on Modern Hindi. Whatever setbacks they might have faced before, it was their time to shine now, and the Hindus *needed* to distinguish themselves from the “unforgivably disloyal” Muslims of 1857. This meant two things: defining Hindi (which really meant denying the obvious connection between the origins of Urdu and Hindi), and cozying up with the British to gain influence.[^85]

In the years following the Indian Rebellion there was a flurry of pro-Hindi and pro-Nagari script activity, especially in the Northwest Provinces and Oudh (NWP&O). The Benares Institute was founded in 1861 and the Allahabad institute just a few years later; both would become important centers of Hindi/Nagari advocacy.[^86]

Benares, for instance, would play a leading role in the development of Hindi nationalism. It was here that the Nagari Pracharini Sabha (NPS), or Society for the Promotion of Naragi, was founded in 1893. The NPS grew quickly. Before long, its membership was in the hundreds, and it was receiving thousands of rupees in donations. 

The NPS would play an outsized role in defining Hindi, at least until around World War I, at which point the Hindi Sahitya Sammelan (HSS), or Society for Hindi Literature, founded in Allahabad in 1910, became the primary Hindi institution.[^87]

But that was all to come. Directly after the rebellion in 1857, there were two main bases of support for Hindi.

One was among writers and educators, who were generally supporters of the Sanskritic Hindu tradition. They were not, however, so fanatical about Sanskritizing Hindi, as they were strongly influenced by educational norms of the time, which included teaching young students Persian.

The second was the reformist Hindu movement, notably the organization known as the **Arya Samaj**, founded in 1875. Inspired in part by the successful standardization of Bengali, this group put Sanskrit on a pedestal, and were willing to go to great lengths to restore it to its former glory.[^88]88 The Hindi that would develop here would be a highly-Sanskritized one, the Sanskrit counterpart of the highly-Persianized Urdu patronized by the Urdu elite.[^89]

The Arya Samaj’s proposals were rejected by most of the more traditional Hindu organizations. Internal religious controversies erupted between these groups, leading to an extreme increase in publishing and public speaking, all in Hindi. Though Hindu society was not reformed as much the Arya Samaj had wanted, they were successful in reforming Hindi. The highly-Sanskritized Hindi (“school Hindi”) was the new standard, and even became a mandatory subject in all Arya Samaj educational institutions.

The Hindi movement also found strong support among Bengalis. Bengal was educating its citizens – in Hindi – faster than it could do anything with them, and so these citizens started making their way west in search of better lives. 

This large, new population of Bengalis in the northwest was one of the earliest bases of support for Hindi as a national language. Bengalis were prominent in pro-Hindi mobilization efforts and could be found in important positions at the Benares Institute and Allahabad Institute, the centers of the Hindi movement.

The newly-arrived Bengalis were met with hostilities by the NWP&O elite, which consisted mainly of Muslims. The Bengalis played up the democratic nature of their position. Given their population numbers, Muslims were vastly overrepresented in the elite, which meant that Hindi nationalists and pro-Hindi Bengalis had to actively fight against the elite for Hindi’s recognition. This was used as a rallying cry, reinforcing the element of Hindi being a socially disadvantaged language that was built into the very roots of the Hindi movement.[^90]

#### Nagari: An inseparable part of Hindi 

The conflict between the Nagari and Perso-Arabic scripts would be one of the most visible symbols of the ever-growing divide between Hindi and Urdu.

Script was often confused with language. “Hindi”, “Hindi character”, “Nagari”, and “Nagari character” were essentially interchangeable, while on the other side “Persian”, “Persian character”, and “Urdu” were constantly confused.[^91] This identification of language and script hinted at public perceptions that script and language were equivalent.

The Nagari script was a non-negotiable position in the Hindi supporter platform. They presented it as an issue of democracy: the Nagari script was the democratic underdog against the authoritarian Perso-Arabic script of the Muslim oppressors – an exaggerated position, but not without a kernel of truth. 

The argument was that the Nagari script was so much more widely known the Perso-Arabic one, and so using it would be a much more democratic option and would have numerous benefits for all of Indian society. That’s the kernel of truth – they *were* correct in stating that more people were familiar with the Nagari script, and that using it could bring benefits to the underrepresented Hindu population.

The problem is that another script, Kaithi – a sort of cursive of the Nagari script – was *even more* widely used than the Devanagari form of the Nagari script advocated for by Hindi ideologues.[^92] But they rejected this form, because it was perceived to be associated with Hindustani rather than Sanskrit, and because both Hindus and Muslims were familiar with it, meaning it might not be “pure” enough, among other reasons.[^93] In other words it was no *Deva*nagari – *deva* meaning “heavenly, divine” or referring to Hindu deities.[^94]

Whatever their reasons, the fact of the matter was that Nagari was put forth as *the* script of Hindi, and it was a demand that they would not compromise on.

#### A problem defining Hindi, or: The Story of Ayodhya Prasad Khattri

At the end of the 19th century, the foundations of Hindi had certainly been set. It was to be written in the Nagari script, and it showed strong Sanskrit influences. But its development as a literary language was by no means complete yet, and there was a major development still to come. 

Now, Hindi meant two things, even in the context of literary languages. For prose, it meant the highly-Sanskritized style developed in places such as Fort William College and the Arya Samaj. For poetry, though, it still referred to Braj, which was holding onto its position as the dominant poetic language that it had had since the late 15th century.

In 1887, one Ayodhya Prasad Khattri published a book (at his own expense) titled *Khari Boli ka Padya.* In it, he argued that Khari Boli – that is, Hindustani, the foundation (and common ground) of Hindi and Urdu –  should not just be the language of prose, but also of poetry. Hindustani, he argued, was just as good as language for poetry as Braj was, even if no literary tradition existed for it yet, and should replace it.[^95]

Khattri set out a few different classifications of Hindustani. Three are relevant here:

1. “Pandit” style, which was the heavily-Sanskritized variety being advocated for by Hindi ideologues. 
2. “Maulvi” style, which was the Persianized and Arabicized version.
3. The style Khattri preferred, a sort of middle ground between the two, the common Hindustani widely spoken and understood across India.[^96]

The claim wasn’t even anything particularly revolutionary. Bhartendu Harishchandra, considered the father of Modern Hindi, had already advocated for the common Hindustani style for prose. And Khattri did not intend to be revolutionary, either. All he wanted was to move away from the archaic Braj and to persuade those writing in Urdu to switch over to Nagari. It would be a compromise: Urdu speakers would abandon their script and write in the Nagari script instead, and Hindi speakers would abandon Braj and use the common Hindustani variety as the basis for prose.

Given how *not* revolutionary this was, the extreme reaction to the ideas in his book shows just how important the issues at hand were.

Years after he had published the book, Khattri showed up at a meeting of the NPS in Benares. His response was less than friendly, to put it mildly:

"Khattri was treated with conspicuous hostility. While “B.A. Pass Babu Shyam Sundar Das”, the Nagari Pracharini Sabha busybody, cajoled Guleri [another writer] to join the group that was being photographed to mark the inauguration, he pointedly ignored Khattri. Eventually, someone noticed the aged crank [Khattri] who was the father of it all [i.e. Khari Boli Hindi]."[^97]

The fatal flaw in Khattri’s arguments for Hindustani over Braj as the basis for Hindi poetry was that he argued that they were different languages. This idea subverted what Hindi ideologues had been working so hard on for so long. Hindustani, with its obvious connections to *Urdu*, just wouldn’t cut it as *Hindi’s* literary variety – at least when Khattri presented it. Khattri’s opponents defended Braj as strongly as they did *specifically because of its perceived distance from Urdu.*^[98]

There was something quite odd  about the general controversy that arose as a result of the publication of *Khari Boli ka Padya* and Khattri’s activism on behalf of Hindustani. Very early on in its existence, the NPS felt that the fact that Hindi had two different varieties for its literary standard – Braj for poetry and Sanskritized Hindustani for prose – presented a major obstacle to the unity of Hindi. But when Khattri came around and proposed a way to solve this issue, he was completely shunned.

The debate would last quite a while, with arguments in favor of and against both Braj and Sanskritized Hindustani. The main argument against common Hindustani was that it would spread the influence of Urdu (due to the perceived connection between the two).[^99]

The debate, however, ultimately turned in favor of Sanskritized Hindustani – the Pandit style being advocated by ideologues – when Mahavir Prasad Dwivedi, editor of the most influential Hindi periodical of the early 20th century, began writing poetry in a Sanskritized Hindustani and encouraged anyone who submitted to the journal to do the same.[^100]

And so after all there was no compromise. The literary variety of Hindi would be based entirely on the highly-Sanskritized version of Hindustani.

#### A bump in the road

Taking the Hindi movement’s arguments to the British, Raja Shivaprasad, a prominent Education Department official, submitted a memorandum in 1868 concerning the official language of British administration. His arguments were not about the language itself, but rather *specifically against the Perso-Arabic script.* The arguments were on the basis of cultural identity: the Semitic script, he argued, alienated the Indian people from their Aryan speech, which made it unsuitable as the official script.[^101]

At first, the British responded that they would think about it – in other, words, they did nothing. But after receiving another memorandum in favor of Hindi/Nagari (we’ll refer to this as just Hindi from now on) with the usual arguments in 1873, they actually spat in the face of Hindi supporters and issued an order requiring proficiency in *Urdu* - in the Perso-Arabic script – for all government positions above a certain level.[^102] 

This decree was especially insulting, given that the educational system implemented by the British was teaching Indians standardized forms of local languages or of Hindi,[^103] but now it was *Urdu* proficiency that was required in order to make it in the government. The order would be rescinded in 1896, but the damage had been done: the inconsistency in educational and employment policy would later form the basis of arguments in favor of Hindi.

In 1882, the British government formed a committee under Sir William Hunter to review the progress of education in India. There was mass mobilization of supporters of Hindi and of Urdu, and the usual arguments of each camp were made. 

In the end, though, Sir Syed Ahmad Khan, a high-ranking member of the Viceroy of India’s Legislative Council, argued that the debate between Hindi and Urdu was entirely political and had nothing to do with education. This put an end to the committee, and the Hindi supporters got the message: the British weren’t going to listen. One Hindi newspaper in Benares warned: “If the Government does not listen we must cry out so loudly that the sound reaches its ear.”[^104]

#### MacDonnell’s Order

Hindi supporters would have to wait a little while, but all hope was not lost.

In 1895, a prominent (at least to Hindi supporters) British advocate of Hindi, Sir Anthony MacDonnell, was appointed Lieutenant Governor of the NWP&O. This set off a massive revival of Hindi mobilization.

On Thursday, 2 March 1898 at noon, Madan Mohan Malaviya, editor of a Hindi nationalist weekly publication and and future president of the HSS, brought a delegation of 17 prominent citizens to a meeting with MacDonnell at the Government House in Allahabad. 

Malaviya presented a memorandum he had written called *Court Character and Primary Education in NWP&O*, which provided a history of the Hindi-Urdu controversy as well as arguments in favor of Nagari in a presentation filled with statistics and documentation. 

The main argument was the inconsistency between British educational policy which favored Hindi and British employment policy, which favored Urdu. Malaviya argued that this inconsistency should be resolved in the favor of Hindi.

To be clear, Malaviya did not want it to be resolved in favor of *highly-Sanskritized* Hindi – he wanted to raise the Hindi *spoken by the people* (that is, Hindustani) to a higher level to improve education in the whole province. He even cited the events of 1857-8 as a result of lack of education.

MacDonnell liked the arguments, but he was quick to warn against antagonizing the establishment, who would be sure to rise to defend the status quo.[^105] He knew that there was no easy solution to this issue, and in the end sided with Malaviya. On 18 April 1900, MacDonnell initiated an order for the Nagari script to be used in NWP&O, and on 26 June 1900 it was officially promulgated.[^106]

There was one hitch that came up: MacDonnell’s original order *only* had to do with the question of script. The order had said that when hiring, candidates would need to be able to *read* both the Nagari and Perso-Arabic scripts fluently. But during the process of ratification, the order was modified to state that candidates would need to be able to *speak* the Hindi and Urdu *languages* fluently.[^107]

Predictably, this decision was praised by supporters of Hindi and vehemently criticized as too sympathetic to the Hindi cause by supporters of Urdu. The Punjab Observer, an Urdu periodical, wrote on 4 July 1900: 

>"We cannot but characterize [MacDonnell’s order] as anything short of a grave political blunder, and history written a hundred years later will have to mourn the mistake made in 1900."[^108]

Urdu opposition to the decree did not last long, however. The Muslim elite quickly backed off the issue when MacDonnell began to apply some pressure.  After all, they were ever more worried about maintaining their dwindling political power, which was entirely dependent upon maintaining cordial relations with the British.[^109]

This development was huge. **For the first time ever, the idea of Hindi and Urdu as distinct languages was given official, government endorsement**.

### Partition and Independence: Before and After

Back in 1885, the Hindi nationalist movement was taking root, and the India National Congress (INC) became the first modern nationalist movement among countries under British control in Africa and Asia.

As a sort of “national consciousness” spread from Bengal across India at the end of the 19th century, the middle class, which was increasingly educated, responded positively to Hindi publications. The ground rules of a standardized, Sanskritized Hindi were well-established, and the first experiments in Hindi creative writing began.[^110]

From 1868 to 1914, Hindi publications exploded, outnumbering Urdu publications three to one. This was due in large part to the British, whose educational policies demanded hundreds of thousands of Hindi texts in the Nagari script and created thousands of jobs dependent upon Hindi literacy.[^111]

By the time the INC became a mass movement under the leadership of Mahatma Ghandi, Hindi had developed significant recognition in the densely-populated northern provinces of Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Bihar. It had enough recognition to be a serious challenge to Urdu’s supremacy. 

Interestingly enough, despite the ever-widening divide between Hindi and Urdu ideologues, English provided a sort of bridge, allowing the INC to attract support from across the communal divide. Even after Muhammad Ali Jinnah became leader of the All-India Muslim League in 1935 and brought it to the center of the debates, Muslims could still be found in INC leadership. Many would even receive senior positions in the party after the partition of 1947.[^112]

But the pleasant times would not last forever, and eventually the extremes of the political spectrum came to dominate debate. It was clear that English wouldn’t do as a national language, but it wasn’t at all clear which language would replace it. 

A great deal of effort in the 1930s and 40s went into extensive – and heated – debates about the pros and cons of Hindi, Urdu, or, as a compromise, a non-Sanskritized, non-Persianized Hindustani.[^113] The idea of partition had not yet come up, and so the stakes were high: which language would replace English?

#### Whose battle?

It is difficult to maintain that the Hindi-Urdu battle, which was in full swing, was *really* as much of a battle on behalf of the people as the elite on both sides made it out to be. The reason for this is simple: at the time, there was near total illiteracy in India – something like 97% of the population had no command of written Hindi or Urdu.[^114]

The Hindi advocates had latched on to presenting Muslims as the villains in the situation, and from that point on it was a vicious race to the bottom for linguistic – but really sociopolitical – supremacy.

The Muslim elite were represented by the Muslim League which had recently formed at the beginning of the 20th century. It had been formed with the help of Syed Ahmad Khan, the man who years ago had ended the Hunter Commission by saying that the Hindi-Urdu debate was entirely political, and had nothing to do with education. 

Khan’s main strategy in the Muslim League was to highlight the fact that Urdu had its origins in not just one group of people, but among all classes and all communities. Furthermore, Hindi’s attack on Urdu threatened communal peace and harmony. These were common themes among defenders of the status quo.[^115]

Hindi supporters were explicitly out to *challenge* the status quo, and had a few words about this “all classes and all communities” business. They saw it as no more than the base of traditional establishment power, and so there was *no choice* but to challenge Muslim hegemony.

#### Hindustani: a possible compromise

Hindi and Urdu, as we have seen, had grown to the extremes of how they were defined: Hindi was so Sanskritized and Urdu so Persianized as to be unintelligible to anyone but the elite who had carefully manipulated these languages along communal lines.

But there was still Hindustani, the language of the people, the common ground between the excessively-Sanskritized Hindi and excessively-Persianized Urdu of the Hindu and Muslim elite, respectively. 

At the helm of the INC, Ghandi was in favor of the democratic power of Hindustani as a language to empower the population, to prevent the elite Hindi and Urdu from alienating all but a small fraction of the population. 

Ghandi refused to believe that Hindi and Urdu were separate languages. To him, Hindi did not refer to the highly-Sanskritized version of Hindustani but rather to the language that both Hindus *and* Muslims speak – Hindustani – regardless of whether it was written in Devanagari or in the Persian script. He pointed out that only in the case of the language of the *literary elite* was there a barrier between Hindi and Urdu, one that they had deliberately created.[^116]

In other words, Hindustani (Hindi, in Ghandi’s words) was a revolution against the elite who had been drawing Hindi and Urdu apart for all these years:

>"[Hindustani] was also a political gesture for unity between Hindus and Muslims of North India and at the same time an open invitation to Indians from other speech communities to accept a broadbased Hindi as the common national language."[^117]

Ghandi saw no future for the elite versions of Hindi and Urdu, and he believed that not only did they cause unnecessary antagonism between Hindus and Muslims, but also that these extremist varieties would die off before too long.

And in 1925 Ghandi’s vision for Hindustani even had some success when Ghandi convinced the Indian National Congress to adopt it as the official language for their proceedings.

And he was not the only one in favor of Hindustani. In the face of the British, many of the strongest supporters of the Hindi nationalist movement had actually been *non-native* Hindi speakers – Ghandi included (he spoke Gujarati). They could all unite behind the idea of a national community where everyone would be bilingual, speaking their local dialects but using Hindi for national communication.[^118]

Ghandi’s influence had even won Hindustani some powerful supporters. Jawaharlal Nehru, the soon-to-be first Prime Minister of India, spoke highly of it, declaring that it should be officially recognized as the language of India.[^119]

But Hindustani would not survive for very long. 

The militant wing of Hindi supporters had become more extreme than ever, slowly asserting more and more authority. Ghandi, who had even served as the president of the HSS and had little trouble getting them to go with his plans for Hindustani, was forced to resign due to criticism from the more orthodox Hindi leaders within the organization as well as Urdu leaders outside of it. Support for “Hindi” now meant nothing less than unwavering support for the highly-Sanskritized Hindi.[^120]

On the other side, the All-India Muslim League declared in 1937 that they would do everything within their power to make Urdu the universal language of India.

Hindustani, despite whatever successes it may have had, just was not able to get either the elite supporters of Hindi or Urdu to budge. Compromise was just not a political reality.[^121]

#### The Constituent Assembly

Formed in 1946 while India was still under British rule, the Constituent Assembly of India would serve as India’s first Parliament after the 1947 Indian Independence Act partitioned British India into two territories: India and Pakistan (which also controlled what is now Bangladesh). Its sessions were conducted either in Hindustani or in English, showing just how appealing the idea of Hindustani was.[^122]

But the appeal of Hindustani was already gone by July 1947 at the fourth Constituent Assembly session, when the inevitability of a partition along religious lines became clear. The Muslim League identified Urdu as the symbol of Muslim separatism,[^123] and supporters of Hindi saw support for Hindustani as nothing more than appeasement of the Muslim base. They withdrew all support for Hindustani and demanded that Hindi in the Devanagari script – and only Hindi – be the official language of India.[^124]

But even *after* the partition of India and Pakistan, there was no clear winner from among Hindi, Urdu, and Hindustani. English remained the language of the educated elite, and Hindi had not achieved the sort of complete national domination it had been trying to achieve. The Constituent Assembly, tasked with writing a constitution for India, would have to choose a winner.

Unsurprisingly, choosing a winner was one of the most controversial issues of the entire Constituent Assembly. Debate had become incredibly heated right from the start of the post-partition talks. Many moderate members of the assembly became seriously worried that the issue would destroy any chance of producing a constitution, or worse, would destroy the Constituent Assembly itself. The solution was that all talks about anything having to do with language were postponed to the end of the assembly.[^125]

From 1 August – 14 September, 1949, the Constituent Assembly finally debated the language question.

On one side were delegates from Hindi-speaking states, led by UP freedom fighter Purushottam Das Tandon and Malaviya, former president of the HSS, both of whom were closely related to the Hindi literary elite. They claimed to speak on behalf of the people – as Hindi advocates had for a long time now. They spoke with a sense of moral superiority, asserting that they were upholding democracy. One INC member even taunted the opposition by asking:

>"Are they afraid of democracy? Are they afraid of Parliament? Are they afraid of their own sons and grandsons who will be the members of our future Parliaments?"

On the other side were those who were frightened by the nascent Hindi imperialism, which seemed poised to make its best attempt at replacing every language in India by whatever means necessary. And this fear was not without reason – INC leader Ravishankar Shukla had even given a not-so-subtle warning to the south, where resistance to Hindi was especially strong:

>"I can say to my friends in the South that so far as they are concerned, it would be in their best interests to learn Hindi as early as possibly, because if they do not learn Hindi quickly enough, they will be left behind."[^126]

As arrogant as the Hindi-supporting side may have been, the political reality was that they could not ignore the coalition formed by all non-Hindi speaking delegates if they wanted to achieve their goals. That being said, a 78 – 77 vote in favor of Hindi against the Hindustani in 1949 demonstrated that the Hindi bloc was a force to be reckoned with.[^127]

In fact, Hindi had some obstacles to overcome, such as its lack of prestige among non-Hindi speaking regions and abysmal literacy rates in comparison with other languages.[^128]

And in the end they did overcome those obstacles, but with a compromise. The **Munshi-Ayyangar formula** which stated that Hindi in the Devanagari script would be the official language of India, used for all official communication between states. But it also stated that English would continue to be used for 15 years after the effective date of the constitution (1950) for all legal purposes in order to ease the transition.** After those 15 years, a new commission would be convened to reassess the situation.

#### 1950 – 1965

For the 15-year period from 1950-1965 in which Hindi would replace English, Hindi ideologues wasted no time preparing it for its upcoming role as India’s official language. They began inventing long lists of technical terminology, using Sanskrit words as the basis.

There were other political movements going on at the time as well. The provinces of British India had been determined based on administrative convenience for the British, and it was clear that some borders would need to be readjusted. Political mobilizations eventually led to the States Reorganisation Act of 1956, which was a major redrawing of boundaries along linguistic lines.[^129]

One obvious problem that had not been solved in the Constituent Assembly was education: what language would people study in?

In 1956, the Central Advisory Board of Education took on this problem, and in 1961 out came the so-called “three-language formula.” The idea was to create (at least formal) equality between Hindi and other Indian languages. The plan was that people would make use of three languages:

1. Non-Hindi speakers would learn Hindi
2. Hindi speakers would learn another Indian language of their choice
3. All would learn an European language (which meant English for just about everyone).

Perhaps it was a good idea in theory, but it was a complete failure in practice. In non-Hindi states, Hindi instruction was rare. In Hindi-speaking areas, the requirement to learn another Indian language was met with malicious compliance. Most students chose Sanskrit, Urdu, or other language varieties extremely close to Hindi, rather than languages of the other states of India.[^130]

There was another issue concerning Hindi: the definition of Hindi given in [Article 351](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_India/Part_XVII#Article_351_{Directive_for_development_of_the_Hindi_language_}) of the constitution tries to accomplish so much that the result is a piece of legislation open to a wide variety of interpretations.[^131] Supporters of Hindustani took it as recognizing Hindustani, while Hindi groups took it as endorsing Sanskritized Hindi.

To the elites engaged in this Sanskritization of Hindi, the politics of the situation were clear. They were creating a national identity around Hindi, and, according to KC Chattopadhyaya, President of the HSS, Sanskrit words "are used in the same form everywhere. Therefore only that language can be acceptable all over India which is rich in pure Sanskrit words."

In other words, to them, the only acceptable form of Hindi for the whole nation would be a Hindi that was not the language of one specific people – and so marked by regional variation – but one of the *whole* people, with specific usages of different people erased.[^132]

In 1963, with the 1965 deadline fast approaching, the Lok Sabha (lower house) of the Indian Parliament began looking into the language question again.

Strong opinions were given by all sides. Prime Minister Nehru, always the linguistic moderate, promised non-Hindi regions that Hindi would not be imposed on them. They demanded that English continue as an official language, and that Hindi not be given the status of *sole* official language.

In response, Nehru pushed through the [Official Languages Act of 1963](http://rajbhasha.nic.in/en/official-languages-act-1963) which accepted Hindi as the official language of India but kept English on as a second official language. No *national* language was identified, though. 

This was a brilliant play: Hindi would be recognized as the *official* language, but would not be given the much more culturally significant role of *national* language.

Non-Hindi regions remained skeptical. The 1963 act said that English “may continue to be used”, and they feared that future administrations would interpret that as “may not.”[^133] Their fears were soon realized when Nehru died in 1964 and the next Prime Minister, Gulzari Lal Nanda, began initiating pro-Hindi governmental actions, such as issuing an inquiry to governmental agencies across India as to the specific ways that they would implement Hindi after the 1965 deadline.

When news of this inquiry reached non-Hindi areas, the result was explosive.

The reaction in Tamil Nadu, a southern state with a strong cultural identity built around their non-Indo-European, Dravidian language Tamil, was particularly violent. Tamil Nadu had been the site of continuous anti-Hindi sentiment for decades, and it hit a boiling point with this piece of news.

There were protests, riots, and significant violence - 66 people were killed and two even committed self-immolation. The people of Tamil Nadu made themselves perfectly clear that the Indian government could not impose languages on people against their wishes.

It would not be until 1967 that the non-Hindi demand for continued official usage of English would be met in [an amendment]( http://rajbhasha.nic.in/sites/default/files/olact1963eng.pdf) to the 1963 Official Languages Act. The amendment stated that English would be kept on as an “associate additional official language” and that Hindi would *never* become the sole official language as long as a non-Hindi state objected to it.

### Hindi and Urdu today

Today, it is precisely this “associate additional” English that remains dominant in India. English is the last obstacle Modern Hindi faces in its quest to become the *sole* official language of India.  And the obstacle appears insurmountable: English provides a level of access to institutions – social, political, economic, and so on – that Hindi still cannot rival.[^134]

That is not to say that English will continue to be the language of India for all time. There is no question, in fact, that English represents extreme privilege in India, and that English’s reign in India will be an unstable one due to the complex connotations associated with it and its relationship with Modern Hindi and Urdu.

But English remains a tool of anti-Hindi opposition. In the south especially, English remains popular as a [language of education](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/telangana/telugu-medium-education-losing-favour-with-students/article24617973.ece).

In the end, it *was* Sanskritized Hindi that won out over all other languages. What counts as “correct” language is defined by those considered to be the masters of the language. In this case, that continues to be Hindi literary authors who come from the Hindi movement tradition. As has been the case since back in Gilchrist’s time, “purity” is highly valued, and as long as that is the case, the literary Hindi promoted by the government – whether it be through radio broadcasts such as All-India Radio or through educational policy – will remain far removed from the ordinary language of the people.

The domain of the “Hindi area” now includes the Indian states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Haryana, and Himachal Pradesh, as well as the Union Territory of Delhi. That is to say, in these areas, Modern Standard Hindi (MSH) is the language of administration, education, literature, and so on. The number of native Hindi speakers continues to grow, and numerous dialects once considered separate languages – and which are usually far older than Hind – are now thought of as falling under the umbrella of “Hindi”.[^135]

The extreme fringes of Hindi support have since dwindled, but Hindi lives on. It is spoken by 531 million people in India, 258 million of whom are native speakers – an astounding [*41% of the population*](http://www.censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/Census_Data_Online/Language/Statement5.aspx). The next closest language in terms of number of native speakers is Bengali, with 8% of the population as speakers.

That also makes it the third [most-spoken language in the world](https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/hindi-along-with-chinese-and-english-will-rule-digital-world-pm/article7637031.ece), after Mandarin and English. 

Present-day conceptions among Indians of Hindi’s origins and its place in society today are a product of its history of defining itself against Urdu and claiming the status of the language of the people. For example, many in would claim that Hindi is the *national* language of India – [it isn’t.](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/stories-they-tell-about-languages/article4747023.ece)  Hindi was made the *official* language, but not the *national* language.

Someone might reasonably then ask: What’s the difference? Does it even matter?

The answer: There is a difference, and it does matter.

When the [8th schedule to the Constitution of India](https://mha.gov.in/sites/default/files/Eighth_Schedule.pdf) identified 14 language, or when they recognize others – it’s up to 22 official languages now, with demand for 38 more – the government formally acknowledges the claims of the speakers of those languages for official recognition of their identity.

Picking a *national language*, though, means assigning Indian identity to just *one* language – or at least that is what Hindi advocates have unsuccessfully argued for.  

Remember just how violent the conflicts became in the struggle over picking even an official language, how fundamental the battle for linguistic supremacy over the centuries was for the development of many cultural identities. Calling one language the national language is really something more than it being an official language; southern states were willing to tolerate English as an official language, so long as it would stop Hindi from complete domination.

Urdu was ultimately less successful than Hindi, at least in India. It is a Schedule VIII (official) language in India, and the official language of the state of Jammu and Kashmir, as well as the second official language of UP, Bihar, and Andhra Pradesh.[^136] That being said, its 29 million speakers – a sizeable number (which may be over- or underestimated for political reasons) –  constitutes a mere 5% of the population. 
 
But it is important to maintain perspective: Urdu remains one of the most-spoken languages of the world, despite whatever attempts Hindi supports may make to portray it as simply a lowly variant of Hindustani.[^137] Urdu can be found in often found in [Bollywood movies](https://blog.scienceandmediamuseum.org.uk/decoding-the-bollywood-poster/), alongside Hindustani, which lives on as well, official recognition or not. It is the official language of Pakistan (alongside English) where it is spoken [by 109 million people](https://www.ethnologue.com/language/urd) – the majority of the population, and it remains the literary, cultural, and religious language of Muslims in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh, as well as communities overseas.[^138]

### One language or two?

We have seen the parallel developments of Hindi and Urdu as they twisted and turned with the numerous events and factors that pushed them this way and that. We have seen how the two languages began, and how they stand today. But the question remains: **are they two languages, or one?**

The short answer: it’s complicated.

The long answer: **Hindi and Urdu are two *literary styles* of the same dialect.[^139] At the colloquial level, they are almost identical. There are of course some minor differences in usage, but on the whole, it is not always possible to tell whether someone is speaking Hindi or Urdu straight away.[^140]

But at the same time, the perception that they are separate languages is very real.

That sense is the sociopolitical reality of the situation. The common perception of them *is* as separate languages – a Muslim will refer to their language as Urdu and a Hindu as Hindi, even though there may be little difference between the two languages. That the Constitution of India certainly seems to see them that way only further cements the public perception that they are separate languages.

The question of script also continues to play an important role in defining cultural identity.[^141] To many, the fact that Hindi and Urdu are written with different scripts is all the evidence they need to say that they are two separate languages.

Adding to this perception is the lack of mutual intelligibility in the upper registers of Hindi and Urdu – that is, formal speech, such as that in radio broadcasts or other media. In these contexts, the deliberate (successful) moves to Sanskritize Hindi and Persianize Urdu have rendered then mutually *un*intelligible.

The story of Hindi and Urdu provides an extremely intricate insight into just how important language can be in the formation of identities, whether they be cultural, communal, national or whatever else. The conclusion that they are two standards of a single language cannot be denied, but given the stakes, politics and perception often take precedent.

And that’s the story of Hindi and Urdu – a story of names.

[^1]: Quoted in King (1992: 184). The student continues: “If the purity of Hindi is to consist in its exclusion of Mussulman words, we shall require to study Persian and Arabic in order to ascertain which of the words we are in the habit of issuing every day is Arabic or Persian, and which is Hindi. With our present knowledge we can tell that a word is Sanscrit, or not Sanscrit but if not Sanscrit, it may be English or Portuguese instead of Hindi for anything that we can tell. English words are becoming as completely naturalized in the villages as Arabic and Persian words, and that you call the Hindi will eventually merge in some future modification of the Oordoo, nor do we see any great cause of regret in this prospect.”

[^2]: The history of the spread of languages in India is complex and hard to pin down. In *The Indo-Aryan Languages*, Masica 1991: (1991: chapter 3) provides a detailed overview, which traces not only Sanskrit (and its predecessors) but also the rest of the languages that rose and fell over the millenia.

[^3]: Shukla 2006: 494.

[^4]: Thomson and Slocum 2018. It was perhaps around 1000 BCE – an approximate date at best – that all of the ancient poems were gathered together, with the addition of some newer materials, and reorganized them into the Rigveda (lit. ‘praise-knowledge”) that we have today. Other arrangements of the poems with alterations for specific purposes, such as a rearrangement of the poems and alternate readings for the purpose of chanting, resulted in the other Vedas, the Samaveda, Yajurveda, and Atharvaveda. The Vedas were accompanied by a growing body of commentary known as the Brāhmaṇas.

[^5]: In fact, the study of Sanskrit by philologist William Jones provided the inspiration for his observation about the relationship between the Indo-European languages: “The *Sanscrit* language, whatever be its antiquity, is of a wonderful structure; more perfect than the *Greek*, more copious than the *Latin*, and more exquisitely refined than either, yet bearing to both of them a stronger affinity, both in the roots of verbs and the forms of grammar, than could possibly have been produced by accident; so strong indeed, that no philologer could examine them all three, without believing them to have sprung from some common source, which, perhaps, no longer exists; there is a similar reason, though not quite so forcible, for supposing that both the *Gothic* and the *Celtic*, though blended with a very different idiom, had the same origin with the *Sanscrit*; and the old *Persian* might be added to the same family.”

[^7]: The term “Sanskrit” generally refers to “Classical Sanskrit”. For discussions of the term “Vedic Sanskrit” see [^this page]:(http://www.rigveda.co.uk/), run by Prof. Karen Thomson of the University of Texas at Austin.

[^8]: This classification is not strictly chronological. That is, the Middle Indo-Aryan languages are not necessarily “younger” than (Classical) Sanskrit. In fact, some show linguistic features which reveal that they did not descend from the Sanskrit of the *Rigveda*, but rather other dialects that are in some respects even more archaic than Rigvedic Sanskrit (Oberlies 2004: 179).

[^12]: Persian was not limited to Muslims, either. Elementary mosque-schools (*maktab*) conducted in Persian appealed even to Hindus who wanted a chance at working in the government bureaucracy. Certain Hindu castes, such as the Kayasths, became especially known for their knowledge of Persian and were often scribes, clerks, and administrators (Shackle and Snell 1990: 3). All of this is not to say that *all* Hindus were willing to accept Persian’s status, and Hindu elementary schools (*pāthsālā*) run by Hindu pandits (teachers) sprung up to rival the *maktab.* 

[^13]: One possible etymology given by Masica (1991: 28): < *kharā* ‘standing’, and so ‘stand[^ard dialect]:’.

[^15]: Though Khari Boli was a principally spoken dialect, there were some attempts at writing it, However, as a whole, there was no serious, sustained effort at producing any literary works in it. Interestingly, one of the leading poet of the 14th century, Amir Khusrau, devoted a long section of one of his poems (*Nūh sipihr*, “Nine Heavens”) to praise of India. He praised “Indian speech” – that is, Khari Boli - saying that it was better than Persian or Turkish because of its “pleasing vocabulary.” Despite this praise, Khusrau himself wrote very little in Khari Boli, and evidently didn’t consider any of what he did write worth saving. This, from a man distinguished in Persian and Arabic poetry, is one key confirmation of Khari Boli’s lack of prestige in North India at the time.

[^17]: The name “Hindustani” would not catch on among its speakers until much later, around the 18th century. Hindustani went by many names, including (but not limited to) “Hindi”, “Dehlavi”, “Hindwi”, and “Rekhta” (Chand 1944: 86).

[^24]: Dakhani – whether it be considered Dakhani Hindi or Dakhani Urdu – is still spoken to this day, and  is centered in Hyderabad, the capital of Andhra Pradesh, with significant communities of Muslim speakers from the Deccan Plateau. The modern version also shows significant influence from the local Dravidian language Telugu. (Shapiro 2014: 277).

[^25]: What the actual spoken vernacular of the Mughal court was at is hard to know, but it does not appear that there was any *one* language that served this purpose, but rather “a diverse collection of languages, different languages for different people on different occasions.” This is true at least up to the 18th century. In the first Mughal emperor Babur’s (1483 – 1530) memoirs we find the Turki language, but by the time that Humayun (1508 – 1556) succeeded him, Babur only used Turki when he didn’t want people to understand a conversation he was having. Still, Akbar’s (142 – 1605) wet nurse spoke Turki, and Akbar himself wanted his son to learn it. Persian was, of course, the language of the courts and of anything official, but apart from native-born Iranians, it was no one’s first language (Lelyveld 1994: 65).

[^26]: There were two main factors that helped Braj gain this prestige: First, an explosion of poetry dedicated to the Hindu deity Krishna in the 16th century. **This poetry provided the basis for the use of Braj in a variety of genres.** One of the great works of Braj poetry praising Krishna was by (the semi-legendary) Surdas, a blind poet and singer. Second, the Mughal capital around this time was in Agra, in northern India where the Taj Mahal would later be built. Agra was already dominated by Braj, and being the literary language of the capital only furthered its prestige.

[^30]: Persian lexicography of the  14th-15th centuries indicates that while Hindustani was making inroads into Persian’s dominance, a large number of people were still reading Persian (Faruqi 2001: 116).

[^32]: At least, this is what Rekhtah originally referred to. It soon came to refer to the very language that that genre was being composed in, and poets began writing in all sorts of different genres of poetry, all still in Rekhtah. Finally – and just to add to the confusion – Rekhtah came to refer just to the plain Hindustani language of the area. 
To provide a more vivid idea of just how mixed Rekhtah is, Faruqi (2001: 117) provides a schematic translation of the first ten *shi’rs* of a *maṣnavī* by the poet Ṣalah (Faruqi uses “Urdu” to refer to what we are calling – for the moment – Hindustani): 
*Sh'r* 1: First line: Persian. Second line: first three words Persian, then an Urdu verb, then the last two words Persian of a construction not used in Urdu at all.
*Sh'r* 2. First line: Persian. Second line: first word an Urdu verb, the rest Persian, but such that it could pass for Urdu.
*Sh'r* 3. First line: Persian. Second line: first three words Persian, then an Urdu verb, then the last two words Persian of a construction not used in Urdu at all.
*Sh'r* 4. First line: could pass for Urdu because it has an Urdu verb; the rest Persian, but assimilable in Urdu. Second line: the first word a Persian verb, the rest Persian, but assimilable in Urdu.
*Sh'r* 5. First line: Persian. Second line: the first four words Urdu, followed by a two-word Persian  construction not used in Urdu at all.

[^33]: The Hindus of North India were initially content with Braj and Awadhi, although many of them were attracted to Urdu (especially those in close contact with the Muslim administration) (Das Gupta 1970: 52).

[^35]: Chand 1944: 52.

[^36]: According to Muhammad Aufi’s *Pure Essences of the Intellect* (*Lubab ul-albab*), the great poet Amir Khusrau (1253 – 1325) wrote some verses in what he referred to as *Hindvī*, but did not regard them as any sort of serious effort. Hindi/Hindvi had not yet developed enough prestige for any author to be willing to publish in it.

[^37]: Chand 1944: 29.

[^38]: For Braj, see footnote 26; Avadhi was popularized as a literary language by poets such as Kabir and Malik Muhammad Jayasi, and on the foundations they laid such great works as Tulasidas’ *Ramcharitamanas* was written.

[^39]: According to Faruqi (2001: 129), the exact info of Wali’s birth are not known with perfect accuracy. He was born in 1665 or 1667, possibly in Aurangabad but also possibly in Gujarat. Regarding the date of his death, it is likely that Wali died in 1707/8. This is the date of his final manuscript, and given the remarkable state of preservation of his works, it seems unlikely that Wali’s literary record, so to speak, would just cut off abruptly. Furthermore, Wali mentions a number of Persian contemporaries, as well as three Dakhani ones, but not a single Rekhtah poet of the north, perhaps because he was not around to see Rekhtah become a major presence in Delhi beginning around 1710.

[^40]: Further evidence of Wali’s lasting appeal is that about one hundred manuscripts of his *dīwāns*, or collections of poetry, have survived three centuries of intense political and social change that would come after him.

[^41]: Faruqi 2001: 138.

[^42]: This obsession became so extreme – the story goes – that Mir wouldn’t even speak to his travelling companions for the duration of a trip from Delhi to Lucknow out of fear that his own speech would be corrupted (Rai 2001: 74). Ironically, when Lucknow became the center of the Muslim aristocracy, their obsession with Persianization would make the one in Delhi look mild.

[^43]: The most prominent story told about Wali and his time in Delhi goes a long way towards explaining the intellectual attitude of the Delhi elite of the time – and even now. The main story, as told by Mir, can be summarized as follows: “When Wali arrived in Delhi in 1700, he consulted with Shah Gulshan, a saint and poet. Shah Gulshan advised him to make use of the Persian literary tradition, rather than the new-fangled language he had brought. Wali took the advice to heart, and when he went back to Delhi in 1720 with a new diwan, it took the city by storm and everyone adopted his style of poetry.”
The main problem with this story is the year of Wali’s death. This is a political question, as the longer Wali was alive after taking Shah Gulshan’s advice, the more he can be said to have been influenced by the Persian poetry of the Delhi elite. This would mean that the Delhi elite would be able to claim that *they* influenced *him*, rather than the other way around.
Another problem is more of a hypothetical. It is certainly likely that Wali met with Shah Gulshan if they were both in Delhi at the same time, and there is even a strong possibility that they already knew each other. However, one question remains: Why did Shah Gulshan – a minor poet – wait for someone from outside of Delhi, or even specifically for Wali, to come to Delhi to give the advice to make use of more Persian themes in his Rekhtah? There were plenty of poets in Delhi already fluent in Persian who were trying their hands at Rekhtah as well who could just as easily have received the advice (Faruqi 2001: 129).
Chandpuri also tells a story in which Wali was not even that well-known of a poet before he met with Shah Gulshan, who encouraged him to write some more verses. This **cannot** be true, however. We have the testimony of some of Wali’s contemporaries who died *before* 1700 that indicates that he was already a serious Rekhtah poet. See Faruqi (2001:137) for quotations of these contemporaries and further arguments against Chandpuri’s story.

[^44]: In a letter dated August 15, 1967, Habib ur-Rahman al-Siddiqi Merathi, an educated man from a distinguished family from Meerut who considered his speech the same as that of Delhi, wrote “[Wali]: has been given too much of a *boost*; he needs to be *debunked*.” Two weeks later he added that “[Wali]: learned [proper]: Urdu when he came to Delhi; its not that he taught [proper]: Urdu to the people of Delhi” (italics in original; quoted in Faruqi 2001: 130, note 2).

[^45]: Lexicographer Syed Maulvi Ahmed Dehalvi, author of *Farhang-i-Asafiya*, derogatorily calls the Hindustani of the people “Purdu”, while “Urdu” is restricted to the dialect of the elite. He adds (quoted in  Rai 2001: 76): “…Nor do we approve of that Urdu which is used by the Christians of Hindustan, by newly-converted Muslims, by foreigners newly arrived, by their cooks and attendants, and by rural folk from the Eastern districts…”

[^46]: Regarding the origins of the  term, in the mid-18th century we find leading Delhi poets such as Mir and Arzu using phrases with the word *urdū* to describe the royal city, Delhi. 46 Mir, for example, describes Rekhta as being spoken in the *urdū-e mu’allā* – the royal city.46 Around the same time, Arzu stated that the Persian of the *urdū* was the “true” Persian.
But it would not be until 1796 that we actually find the first explicit, written use of “Urdu” as a *language name.* In a verse, the poet Mashafi refers to **Persian** as the *zabān-e urdū-e mu’allā-e shāhjahānābād*, or “language of the exalted city/court of Shahjahanabad” (which meant Delhi, at least until the early 19th century).

[^54]: This is part of the comically long subtitle to Gilchrist’s 1820 *The Stranger’s Infallible East-Indian Guide, or: Hindoostanee Multum in Parvo, as a Grammatical Compendium of the Grand, Popular, and Military Language of All India (long, but improperly, called the Moors of Moorish Jargon)*. 
Gilchrist also calls Hindustani a “genuine effusion of nature, and the heart” (Lelyveld 1993: 671), and comments (Gilchrist 1806: lvii) that it is an “elegant language which is used in every part of Hindoostan and the Dukhin, which is the common vehicle of intercourse among well-educated natives and among the illiterate also, in many provinces of India; and which is almost everywhere intelligible to some among the inhabitants of every village.”

[^55]: Masica 1991: 29.

[^56]: As Gilchrist (1820: xiii-xiv) himself describes it, “In every case where a native of hindoostan wishes either to compose or to dictate anything to be translated from his own to another tongue, he constantly arranges his ideas and explains his meaning in hindoostanee, before it be committed to writing as a Persian epistle, or  a political document of any value.”

[^57]: Quoted in Lelyveld (1993: 670), from M. Atique Siddiqi’s (1963) Origins of Modern Hindustani Literature (Naya Kirab Garh).

[^58]: *Truly* painstaking work went into making the dictionary. Gilchrist began with “a” and slowly built on it, going to “ab”, then “abab”, “ababa”, “abach”, and so on and so forth, with his Hindustani employees telling him all the words that came to mind with each combination. 
Incidentally, just after he finished compiling his dictionary, Gilchrist discovered that another army captain, Captain Kirkpatrick, already had a Hindustani-English dictionary in the press. Gilchrist managed to convince Kirkpatrick to be his business associate – after all, the dictionary was an entrepreneurial undertaking more than anything else – and the two soon published a dictionary together.

[^59]: Shackle and Snell 1990: 7.

[^60]: Shapiro 2004: 281

[^61]: In fact, being the entrepreneur he was, Gilchrist even devised his own system for transliterating Hindustani into the Roman alphabet with the goal of  making it easier for the British to learn (though it didn’t catch on in the end) (Lelyveld 1993: 671).

[^62]: Dr. J.F. Ballantyne in Benares – the professor who had asked his students why they hated Hindi so much – was of the same mindset as GIlchrist, if not of even stronger convictions. He wanted to clearly distinguish Hindi from all of the other dialects of the masses, and he wanted to “define and affirm Hindi in terms of a standardized and Sanskritized language created by a vernacular elite” (Rai 2001: 25).

[^63]: To support this claim, Chand (1944: 88) quotes Jules Bloch, author of *La formation de la Language Marathe* (*The formation of the Marathi Language*): “Lallu Lal, sous l’inspiration du Dr. Gilchrist, changea tout cela en ecrivant son celebre Prem Sagar, dont les parties en prose etaient en somme de l’ourdou dont less [^sic]: mots Persans auraient ete remplaces partout par des  mots Indo-aryens…Le  nouveau dialecte donna une ‘langue franque’ aux Hindus”
Lallu Lal, inspired by Dr. Gilchrist, changed everything by writing his celebrated Prem Sagar, in which the prose parts were as a whole Urdu with the Persian words replaced by Indo-Aryan words…the new dialect gave the Hindus a “*lingua franca*.”

[^64]: Das Gupta 1970: 52.

[^65]: Rai 2001: 24.

[^66]: The idea that there should be one language for Muslims – Hindustani – and one for the Hindus – Hindi – would not take root until the British assumed full control, at which point it was imposed fairly quickly. For example, the 1886 *Hobson-Jobson: A Glossary of Colloquial Anglo-Indian Words and Phrases, and of Kindred Terms, Etymological, Historical, Geographical and Discursive* by Henry Yule and Arthur Coke Burnell (417) defines Hindustani as “properly an adjective, but used substantively in two senses, viz. (a) a native of Hindustan, and (b) (*Hindūstānī zabān*) ‘the language of the country,’ **but in fact the language that the Mahommedans of Upper India, eventually the Mahommedans of the Deccan, developed out of the Hindi dialect** of the Doab chiefly, and the territory around Agra and Delhi, with a mixture of Persian vocables and phrases, and a readiness to adopt other foreign words. It is also called *Oordoo*, i.e. the language of the Urdu (‘Horde’) or Camp. **This language was for a long time a kind of Mahommedan *lingua franca* over all India, and still possesses that character over a large part of the country, and among certain classes. Even in Madras, where it least prevails, it is still recognized in native regiments as the language of intercourse between officers and men. Old fashioned Anglo-Indians used to call it the *Moors* (q.v.)” [emphasis added].
See Faruqi (2001: 30-35) for other contemporary definitions of Hindustani and Urdu.
Earlier still, H.H. Wilson’s 1855 *A Glossary of the Judicial and Revenue Terms…of British India*, an analysis of the languages of the India, divided Indian languages into two types: Hindustani, and Hindu languages. Wilson, the Boden Professor of Sanskrit at Oxford, wrote that Hindustani was “an admixture of the original languages of the Mohammadan conquerors with those of the Hindus [^and was]: loosely spread, and at considerable intervals, over the surface” of India. Furthermore, different dialects of the Hindu population belonged to “clearly demarcated geographical regions”. Hindi, Wilson recognized, was not a very specific term, being used to refer to just about any language being spoken in India (quoted in Lelyveld 1993: 673).

[^67]: Rai 2001: 25.

[^68]: Bhartendu Harishchandra, one of the pioneers of Modern Hindi, even acknowledged that in the middle of the 19th century, Urdu was the language of all polite speech in North India.

[^72]: It was exactly this that the Court of the Directors of the East India Company advised in 1830: they wrote that “it is easier for the judge to acquire the language of the people than for the people to acquire the language of the judge.” (Quoted in King 1992: 185, from Malaviya, Madan Mohan *Court Character and Primary Education in N.W.P. and Oudh* (1897), Allahabad: Indian Press.)

[^73]: Not everyone saw it that way, though. For many, Urdu referred specifically to the highly-stylized, Persianized literary variety, and was different from (colloquial) Hindustani (Masica 1991: 30).

[^74]: Lelyveld 1993: 673; Rai 2001: 27.

[^75]:. In 1836, the Sadar Board of Revenue of the North-Western Provinces (NWP) had warned that the change from Persian to Urdu wouldn’t just be inserting some Urdu verbs and keeping Persian vocabulary and idioms, but that was basically what happened in the end (King 1992:185).

[^77]: This would be Ahad Ali Khan Yakta in his *Code for Standard Speech* (*Dastūr ul-fasahāt*) (Faruqi 2001: 39).

[^78]: As late as December of 1858, the famous Urdu poet Ghalib was uncomfortable with the term Urdu, which he employed in the masculine (which meant “city”), rather than the feminine (which meant the language).

[^79]: One of the high points of Urdu literature can be found in the letters of Ghalib (died 1869), who was one of the greatest Urdu poets and one of the last who still felt equally at home in Persian (Shackle and Snell 1990: 8).

[^83]: The only problem with this was that it meant admitting defeat for those same centuries, admitting that ever since the golden days of Ancient India when Sanskrit was king, the Hindus had been defeated by the Muslims. This furthermore also entailed some “complex feats of accommodation, of adjusting and massaging the historical record” to make things all fit together nicely (Rai 2001: 72).

[^84]: King 1992: 182.

[^85]: When the Indian scholar, linguist, and historian Raja Sivaprasad petitioned the British on behalf of the Nagari script in 1868, he made sure to tell them that he was speaking on behalf of the Hindu middle class, who would be happy to accept to British rule. This sycophancy towards the British was of course accompanied by a complete denigration of the image of Muslims (Rai 2001: 35).

[^86]: Rai 2001: 37.

[^87]: King 1992: 183.

[^88]: In fact, they had originally wanted to publish in Sanskrit – they were all certainly proficient enough in it to do so – but were persuaded to write in Hindi. Unsurprisingly, their Hindi was full of Sanskrit influences.

[^89]: Rai 2001: 67.

[^90]: Rai 2001: 54.

[^91]: George Abraham Grierson, an administrator and linguist in India who wrote the monumental *Linguistic Survey of India*, commented that “these fanatics have confused alphabet with language. They say because a thing is written in  Deva-nagari [^sic]: therefore it is Hindi, the language of the Hindus, and because a thing is written in the Persian character therefore it is Urdu, the language of the Musalmans” (Grierson 1903-1928: Vol. IX, part 1, xiv).

[^92]: Thus in Bihar, the government officially implemented it, and it found great success. In 1881 began to be used in schools, and Kaithi texts began to appear more frequently. The move had its fair share of criticism; one Bengali educator, Dr. Rajendralal Mirtra, argued that using the script would disadvantage Biharis in the long-term, not only in that they would not have access to ancient and modern literature written in UP, but also economically (King 1992: 193).

[^93]: For example, that the Kaithi script was illegible and just as ambiguous as the Perso-Arabic script (which, as an abjad, does not typically mark vowels). These factors, some argued, made it unsuitable as a medium of education (King 1992: 193).
The Devanagari – Kaithi debate was in reality one of caste politics: Kaithi was a form of Kayasthi, the script of the Kayastha cast, whereas Devanagari was based on the Nagari script of the Brahmin caste. In fact, Devanagari was also known by another name: Babhni, or the script of the Brahmins.

[^94]: Rai 2001: 52.

[^95]: Another writer, Shridhar Pathak, who was highly-respected for his poetry in both Hindustani and Braj, advocated for Hindustani and wrote its first major poem in 1886. Like Khattri, he saw Braj and Hindustani as two different language. To him, Hindustan had a much brighter future ahead of it, as more people understood it. He also thought that Hindi should have *one* language for its prose and poetry (King 1992: 189).

[^96]: Rai 2001: 85.

[^97]: Rai 2001: 84.

[^98]: Braj poetic tradition was in some ways the foundation of Hindi identity in that it provided a rival to the appeal of Islam, and they were not about to give that up to a dialect they perceived as being so close to Urdu (Rai 2001: 88).

[^99]: For example, Radha Charan Goswami, editor of a Hindi newspaper in Brindaban in the heart of the Braj area, criticized Hindustani, writing that it and Braj were the same language, and that nothing of any substance had ever been written in it. Furthermore, if Hindustani were to be accepted as the literary language of Hindi poetry, it would only help spread Urdu’s influence.

[^100]: 20 years later, in 1910, the first HSS convened in Benares to debate not *whether* Braj should be the literary language of poetry, but rather to what extent they should hold on to what was left of it. A complete reversal had occurred, with harsh condemnations of Braj as the enemy of Hindi (King 1992: 191).

[^101]: Interestingly, Prasad was not actually opposed to Persianized Urdu words in principle, just to the use of the Perso-Arabic script (Rai 2001: 39). King (1992: 188) also quotes one professor, Raj Kumar Sarvadhikari, commenting in 1882 that “Urdu is the dialect of the Muhammadan inhabitants and Hindi of the Hindus.”

[^102]: Rai 2001: 39.

[^103]: The incoherence was at least in part due to the 1813 Charter Act, which had established that the British East India Company would be responsible for educating Indians, but their objectives were vague at best and there was little planning of policies (Das Gupta 1970: 41).

[^104]: Rai 2001: 42.

[^105]: Thus, for example, the Secretary of NWP&O wrote to the Chief Commissioner in Oudh in 1871 that it would be politically dangerous for the government to support Hindi over Urdu (Rai 2001: 44).

[^106]: Rai 2001: 45.

[^107]: It is entirely possible, and even likely, that MacDonnell was in favor of this modification, which was called a mistake in the press. In the wake of riots in Kanpur which were the result of successful inter-community cooperation and coordination, the *Times of India* reported on 5 June 1900 that MacDonnell’s (original) order had been intended in large part to prevent the possibility of such future cooperation between different communities against the British. The 14 June 1900 *Pall Mall Gazette* even cites a wire from MacDonnell himself to support this (Rai 2001: 48).

[^108]: Quoted in Rai (2001: 46).

[^109]: Rai (2001:47) provides the example of MacDonnell providing an ultimatum to Mohsin-ul-Mulk, an “Aligarh bigwig”: either he could remain the Secretary of the Muhammadan Anglo-Oriental College, or he could oppose MacDonnell. Mohsin-ul-Mulk backed down.

[^115]: In fact, the Muslim League utilized different ideas of Urdu in different situations as the politics necessitated. It was either the language of “all classes and all communities” of India or, when it was being threatened, it was a distinctly *Muslim* issue (Rai 2001: 61).

[^116]: Das Gupta 1970: 110. 
As regards the script, Ghandi wrote in Thoughts on National Language (Navajivan, 1956: 5-6): “For the present Muslims will certainly use Urdu script and Hindus will mostly write in Deva Nagari. I say “mostly” because thousands of Hindus even today write in the Urdu script and some even do not know the Nagari script. Finally, when there is absolutely no suspicion left between Hindus and Muslims – when all causes for distrust between the two have been removed, the script which has greater power will be more widely used and thus become the national script. In  the intervening period Hindus and Muslims who desire to write their petitions in the Urdu script should  be free to do so and these should be accepted at all Government offices.”

[^119]: Highly enough, at least to ask a member of the Drafting Committee in the Constituent Assembly, one M. Satyanarayan, to add Urdu to the list of languages that had been prepared for the 8th schedule to the language chapter of the constitution.
Nehru was later confronted about this move by a Hindi-supporting friend, who asked him if he wasn’t ashamed of claiming Urdu as his language. Nehru had nothing to say. Finally, one more language was added to the list: Sanskrit.

[^120]: Rai 2001: 106.

[^121]: The very fact of Urdu’s centering in Pakistan now has itself been a driver of further Persianization. As Shackle and Snell 1990: describes it, “the style of most Urdu writing in Pakistan all too accurately reflects the bombastically Persianized register of the official media” (Shackle and Snell 1990: 19).

[^122]: Das Gupta 1970: 130.

[^123]: Ironically, even after partition, the majority of Urdu speakers would remain in India. Das Gupta (1970: 124) argues further: “Objectively speaking, it can be argued that the utilization of Urdu for political separatism was clearly against the interests of the Urdu speakers as well as the non-Urdu-speaking majority of the Muslims of undivided India.”

[^124]: Dua 2006a: 499.

[^125]: Many Hindi supporters realized that supporting Hindi to such an extent that writing a constitution would fail was not a winning strategy and reigned in the other supporters (Rai 2001: 110).

[^126]: Quoted in Rai 2001: 112.

[^131]: Article 351 reads: “It shall be the duty of the Union to promote the spread of the Hindu language, to develop it so that it may serve as a medium of expression for all the elements of the composite culture of India and to secure its enrichment by assimilating without interfering with its genius, the forms, style and expressions used in Hindustani and in the other languages of India specified in  the Eight Schedule and by drawing, wherever necessary or desirable, for its vocabulary, primarily on Sanskrit and secondarily on other languages.”

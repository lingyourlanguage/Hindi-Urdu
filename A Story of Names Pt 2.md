# Hindi and Urdu: A Story of Names
### Part 2: The Hindi-Urdu Split

---
*Here in Part 2, we take a look at just how the British were crucial to splitting Hindi and Urdu apart. What factors led the British to encourage two separate standards for the languages? In Part 1, we saw how we got to this point from the Sanskrit origins of Hindi and Urdu, and in Part 3 we'll look at the role of nationalisms in the development of separate standard languages. In Part 4, we conclude by looking at Hindi and Urdu from Indian independence up through the present day, and finally answer (or at least try to answer) our main questions: Are Hindi and Urdu separate languages?*

### A convenient fiction

Up until this point in history, all invasions of India had come from Central Asia in the northwest. The strategy of naval assaults utilized by the British East India Company was not successful in the beginning. It was only after they established the trading port of Calcutta at the end of the 17th century – which became their capital and remained so until 1912 – that they began making any sort of real territorial gains in the Indian subcontinent.[^49]49

After their decisive victories in the Battle of Plassey in 1757 and the Battle of Buxar in 1764, which had resulted in a decapitated Mughal Empire, the British had almost complete power over Bengal. But they did assume direct control. What the British did instead was submit – ostensibly, at least – to the authority of the Mughals by assuming the role of *dīvānī*, or chief official, rather than overlord. 

**This was a “convenient fiction”**: all power rested with the East India Company, who was in reality using the Mughals to administer their newly-conquered territories for them. The British slowly extended their control over North India under the guise of Mughal administration, and continued to do so until the 19th century.[^50]50

Linguistically speaking, this had one important effect: The switch from Persian to English and local languages as the language of administration was stretched out a lot longer than it would have been, had the British assumed direct control immediately. 

### Meanwhile, at Fort William College…

For the British, the linguistic situation before and leading up to the 19th century was at best confused. New laws were drafted in English, but the British required their officials to speak with their Bengali subjects in Persian. In fact, the British had to rely on interpreters for over a century and half of their rule.

The only awareness of Hindustani the British had was that it was some “jargon associated with Muslims” that was “useful for giving orders to soldiers and servants.”[^51]51 Though they identified it as a largely Muslim language, they *were* aware that it was spoken or at least understood by a large number of people across India.[^52]52 

The British were well aware that the linguistic incoherence of their policies was taking a toll on the efficiency of their colonial administration. 

And thus was Fort William College in Calcutta born on 4 May 1800. The idea was to teach young British officials the various Indian languages necessary for administration of their empire. Languages included Hindustani, Arabic, Persian, Sanskrit, and provincial languages like Bengali or Braj.[^53]53

#### The Story of John Borthwick Gilchrist

In 1782, a Scottish physician and part-time indigo planter by the name of John Borthwick Gilchrist (1759 – 1841) arrived in Bombay. He took an immediate liking to Hindustani – not the highly-Persianized Hindustani, but the Hindustani that was the language of the people, the one that was based on all those western dialects (but which did still have some borrowing from other languages including Persian and  Arabic). He realized that it was not just some jargon useful for giving orders but actually, as he described it, a “grand, popular and military language of all India.”[^54]54 

This contrasted with what Urdu (that is, Persianized Hindustani) had become: a language far removed from everyday Indian life, a language full of foreign words, written in a hard-to-learn script that hadn’t even been designed for an Indo-Aryan language in the first place.[^55]55 

Gilchrist, ever the entrepreneur, saw an opening.

Gilchrist decided that was really needed was a dictionary and a grammar of Hindustani. Needed not by the Indian population, of course, but by the Europeans in India. After all, how could proper colonial administration proceed smoothly when the British had to navigate a sea of widely different languages, dialects, accents, vocabularies, and so on, all of which the native Indians navigated with ease?

During the process of compiling the dictionary, Gilchrist made use of a distinctly European framework for understanding languages. That is to say, that were tacit ideological commitments underpinning Gilchrist’s work that the native Hindustani speakers did not share.

Gilchrist himself discusses situations that he found himself in that really highlight the different between his conceptions about language and those of the Indians.

One was actually a recurring problem that Gilchrist faced while making the dictionary. The original plan was to fill the dictionary with references to literature to illustrate a word’s usage. However, whenever he would ask one of his Hindustani-speaking employees for references, they often provided references in languages Gilchrist considered beyond the boundaries of Hindustani, but which were to them perfectly reasonable responses.[^56]56

The other was a humorous exchange that occurred between Gilchrist and the educated Hindustani speakers he had hired to help him with the dictionary.

One of Gilchrist’s first steps in his project was to ask the Hindustani speakers if there was any existing dictionary of Hindustani. They looked at him in complete astonishment and asked him “if it was yet ever known in any country, that men had to consult vocabularies, and rudiments for their own vernacular speech.”[^57]57 To them, the idea of a monolingual dictionary – an idea absolutely fundamental to the  European understanding of a standard language – was unthinkable.

Cultural differences or not, Gilchrist powered through. A few months of painstaking work later, the dictionary was ready.[^58]58 

Gilchrist’s work got him appointed Professor of Hindustani at Fort William College in 1800. It was time to put his work into use. Over the next four years, Gilchrist brought together a staff of educated Indians. The goal of his department was to develop a Hindustani *prose* style.

And they were successful: many of the language textbooks created to teach British officers local languages became quite famous, especially the ones for Hindustani (that is, Persianized Hindustnai, or Urdu) prose.[^59]59 All in all, up to 60 instructional books were published for the British servants and officers who needed to learn Hindustani. Script just was not a central issue yet,[^60]60 and so some were printed in the Perso-Arabic script, some in the Nagari script.[^61]61

But the defining moment in the development of Hindi would come just a few years later. 

Originally, Gilchrist had no intention of “purifying” Hindustani in any way. All he wanted to do was firmly establish its boundaries and separate it from the languages of the elites, priests and aristocrats, such as Persian and Sanskrit. In other words, he wanted to figure out **exactly what counted as Hindustani**. 

This was a major ideological difference between Gilchrist and the Indians. **Where Gilchrist saw numerous, distinct languages, each the possible object of study – and standardization – the Indian population saw a broad spectrum dialects related to various degrees, each of which could seamlessly lend to and borrow from other dialects.**

But Gilchrist’s love for Hindustani that eventually led him to worry that it would become tarnished by the presence of too many Persian and Arabic loanwords. He had three of the Indians working for him – the leading poets and authors Insha’llah Khan, Sadal Misra, and Lalu Lal – take the ordinary, mixed Hindustani and remove the Persian and Arabic loans to create a language more suitable for the Hindu population.[^62]62 

One work in particular, the *Ocean of Love* (*Prem sāgar*) by Lalu Lal, changed everything. It was essentially written in Urdu, but the Persian words had been replaced by Indo-Aryan words. Up to this point, there had been no such thing as “Hindi literature.” This was the dawn of Modern Hindi.[^64]63

But the success would not last. This new “Hindi” language would soon fall off the radar, only to be revived later on after the Indian Rebellion of 1857 against the British.

So in a sense, Gilchrist was doubly successful in his goal to develop Hindustani prose. That is, *two* literary standards had been developed: Hindi, purged of Persian words, and Urdu, a Persianized style.[^64]64

#### The missionaries of Serampore

But Gilchrist wasn’t the only force driving the standardization of the *literary* variety of Hindustani that would come to be known as Hindi.

At the end of the 18th century, about the same time as Gilchrist was active, missionaries set up shop in Serampore, near the British India capital of Calcutta. In the eyes of the missionaries, they had arrived in a world of chaos, and they had to create order out of it. Their mission – converting the Indians to Christianity – would end up having a sort of “normalizing” effect on the nascent Hindi literary language.

Take, for example, the importance of the new printing technologies of the day. Not long after arriving in Serampore, the missionaries established what were known as “School Book” societies and were publishing books left and right. But this meant at the very least developing a typeface for Hindi, but typically also meant standardizing the grammar, spelling, and so on.[^65]65

There was another factor that led to more standardization efforts. Outside of the missionaries’ view of India, the idea of separate Hindu and Muslim communities just did not really exist yet.[^66]66 This is not to say that no one was aware of religious differences. Rather, it just means that at the time, religious affiliation was less important in determining one’s cultural identity than other factors. 

The missionaries, however, were prone to privileging religious categories over any other categories. They tried to appeal to the Indians of North India with two variants of the same Hindustani language: one for the Hindus, with all the Perso-Arabic words removed and substituted with Sanskrit words, and one for the Muslims, full of Perso-Arabic borrowings. Ironically, the missionaries’ attempts to turn Indians into “Christians” actually contributed to the development of separate “Hindu” and “Muslim” identities.[^67]67 

#### Early reactions to Hindi

It was certainly not clear that the missionaries in Serampore or the professors of Fort William College had any active desire to cause issues – or were even aware of the potential consequences of their actions – when they began standardizing Hindi and other local dialects. There were practical considerations at play, of course, such as how the British needed to run their colonial administration and train officers and servants, and in their view, doing so would be impossible in the highly mixed linguistic context of India. The development of Hindi was one result of their desire to apply their linguistic framework to Indian languages.

But how did the Hindu population, who Hindi was supposedly being developed for, feel about it?

The answer: It was not clear that they wanted it at all. After all, they had the Delhi literary tradition of Hindustani (that is, Urdu), so why did they need a new one? Though the Muslim community felt an increasing affinity with Urdu, the language was still spoken by an immense number of people, Muslim or otherwise. Through the 18th century, Urdu was the *lingua franca* of both Hindus and Muslims.[^68]68

One point of criticism was actually that supporters of Hindi, both British and Indian, were trying far too hard to Sanskritize Hindustani and create a Hindu-specific variety of Hindustani. 

Sanskrit scholars, who presumably would have some thoughts on this process of Sanskritization, saw no necessary connection between being Hindu and speaking “Hindi.” In fact, one argument was that this Sanskritization was actually the result of the cultural domination of Sanskritized *Bangla* - the language of Bengal – rather than any direct Sanskrit influence.[^69]69

Finally, there was the simple point that the term “Hindi” was vague and ambiguous, given that since the time of the first Persian conquests of India it had been used to refer to any spoken language, and people would likely continue to use it to identify their local dialect.[^70]70

### A new look for Urdu

Now, when the British finally did make the switch from Persian to *local* languages, it was not a uniform process. Newly-published grammars and dictionaries of local languages such as Punjabi, Sindhi, or Burmese had made it possible for them to replace Persian with those languages (which they had standardized) in different provinces. Perhaps more importantly for the British, it allowed them to create an index of official terminology and translations into English – the ultimate language of authority.

There were some easier cases for them: in the south, namely Bombay and the Madras Presidencies, they replaced Persian with Tamil in 1832.  In Bengal, they had recourse to the standardized Bengali language, though it would take them until 1837 to make the switch.[^71]71

The reason they wanted to switch from Persian to local languages was purely practical. There was a persistent problem in their colonial administration: the people going to the courts to work out their problems were rarely proficient in Persian. This did not make for efficient governance. The British wanted to make court proceedings more easily understood by those people, and so they had two choices: get everyone to learn Persian, or just change the language of the courts to the local languages.[^72]72

But some cases were not so easy: What would the British do in the North-West Provinces? 

Colloquial Hindustani varied considerably across India – unsurprising given the geographical size and linguistic diversity of the area in which it was spoken. This would not work for the British – it didn’t fit in neatly with their goal of categorizing and standardizing languages to make them more suitable for their colonial administration needs. 

And so in 1837, the British chose not the colloquial Hindustani of the people, but the Persianized version of the Delhi elite. Because of this, Hindustani and Urdu came to be essentially equivalent to the British,[^73]73 even though there was an ever-widening gap between the colloquial Hindustani of the people and Urdu of the elites, which featured a “largely Perso-Arabic vocabulary.”[^74]74 

The “largely Perso-Arabic vocabulary” quickly became an “excessively Perso-Arabic vocabulary” – so excessive that the Lieutenant-Governor of the North-Western Provinces (NWP) basically admitted that this official Urdu was little different from Persian.[^75]75 

The irony of this decision was not lost on anyone: the official, excessively-Persianized Urdu had been chosen *specifically to make things easier for the people,* but few people had any experience with it at all, written or spoken. In fact, complaints about the excessive Persianization of the courts continued well into the 20th century.

Ironic decision or not, **British support for Urdu would almost single-handedly assure its success and domination as a symbol of Indo-Persian culture.**[^76]76

But there’s an important question we need to answer: *why was there the change of name from Hindustani to Urdu?*

At first, the British had actually preferred the name *Hindustani* for the common language of the people. Given that Hindustani was so widely-spoken as a *lingua franca* across India, it fit the usual pattern: England, English; France, French; Hindustan, Hindustani. Though the term had been in use among native speakers since as early as the 16th or 17th centuries, it was really never as popular as “Hindi” or even “Rekhtah”. 

The name Urdu, however, had several benefits. The obvious one was the clear etymological connection to Turkish – and so also to Muslims. The converse of this was that it had no clear connection to Hindus anymore, which made space for a name to designate whatever the language of the Hindus was.

As early as 1798 we find an educated native Urdu speaker referring to his own language – the language of Delhi – as Urdu. And this was free from considerations of British politics – the book was revised in 1815 in Lucknow, which was not under British control yet.[^77]77 This usage of Urdu fits in with the process we saw above, where *zabān-e urdū-e mu’allā-e shāhjahānābād*, which referred to the language of Delhi, eventually came to refer specifically to Hindustani rather than Persian. 

Non-Muslim native speakers of Urdu resisted the name for the exact reasons the British preferred it. In their view it was highly misleading to the origins and nature of the language, suggesting that it was a non-Indian, Muslim language. As late as 1858, many speakers of Urdu were unsure about the term.[^78]78

One way or another, in the early 19th century, Urdu really had everything going for it. The Muslim population had been feeling increasingly distant from their Persian heritage, and Urdu’s connection to their classical past was the perfect way to compensate for this feeling. Urdu thus became more and more popular among the Muslim population – becoming the official language of a large part of North India certainly didn’t hurt. At a more personal level, Urdu had even replaced Persian as the default language of the Muslim community.[^79]79

### A Turning Point

It is easy to place the blame for the Hindi-Urdu split entirely on the British, to get the (perhaps not incorrect) impression that had the British not colonized and brutally ruled over India, the split would not exist today.

But in an issue as complicated as the status of Hindi and Urdu, it is never that simple.

In fact, there is actually a good case to be made that the British *did not* want Hindi and Urdu to be considered separate languages. Yes, the work carried out at Fort William College had been one of the main contributing factors in the development of Hindi and Urdu as literary styles, but they were just that, and nothing more: *literary styles of the same language.*

This explains administrative documents related to how the British dealt with the Hindi-Urdu controversy. Among these documents are statements such as “it is desirable for the Government to guard most carefully against passing any orders that may countenance the idea that Hindi and Urdu are two distinct languages.” 

In other words, if anything, the British were committed to having one language *with different standards* that would just be enhanced by different influences such as Sanskrit, Persian, or Arabic.[^80]80

The “impulse to divide” – that is, to consider Hindi and Urdu completely separate languages – “came from elsewhere”, as one scholar puts it. That is, the British were certainly a *necessary* condition for the split to happen, but they were not *sufficient* by themselves.[^81]81

Let’s take a look at where that impulse to divide came from.

#### The Indian Rebellion of 1857

The British choosing Urdu as the official language of administration had been a major setback for Hindi. The British’s choice of Urdu made it clear that despite whatever efforts there had been towards developing a Hindi prose style, there was still really was just no accepted, modern style of Hindi which could have been promoted for use in essential administrative functions of the government. 

Hindi was in a tough spot. It did not have anywhere near the wide base of support that colloquial Hindustani had, and it did not have the official recognition that Urdu did.

**The Indian Rebellion of 1857 would be a turning point, the start of Hindi’s dramatic rise to prominence in India.**

In May 1857, in the town of Meerut to the northeast of Delhi, a band of sepoys – Indian soldiers of the British East India Company – rebelled against the rule of the East India Company. Mutinies erupted across central India and were taken extremely seriously by the British.

It took until 1858 for the British to suppress the rebellion. The end result of the Indian Rebellion was that the East India Company was dissolved, and the British assumed direct political control of India, establishing the British Raj. 

The suppression of the rebellion had immense consequences on the ideological frameworks at play in India. 

At the broadest level, the main issue for the Indians was, of course, that the British had won. The Hindi and Urdu elite developed different ways of explaining (and justifying) what had happened to them. In Urdu circles, there was a general sense of defeat, of having to accept the British colonialist view of Indians as degenerates. There was nostalgia for the golden days of Mughal power and elite Muslim aristocracy. 

Hindu elites had a similar general sense of defeat and acceptance of the British colonialist view. But there was one key difference: **The Hindu elite cited centuries of Muslim “tyranny” as the cause of the “Old” India’s problems and the subsequent repression of the rebellion**.[^82]82

This gave Hindu ideologues a good explanation for the current state of affairs as well as the repressed memories of 1857-8. The Hindus could remove themselves from the defeat that had just occurred – in their view, everything that happened was because of the centuries of Muslim rule.[^83]83

To the Hindus, the dark days of Muslim tyranny were waning, and the future was bright.

Gilchrist also calls Hindustani a “genuine effusion of nature, and the heart” (Lelyveld 1993: 671), and comments (Gilchrist 1806: lvii) that it is an “elegant language which is used in every part of Hindoostan and the Dukhin, which is the common vehicle of intercourse among well-educated natives and among the illiterate also, in many provinces of India; and which is almost everywhere intelligible to some among the inhabitants of every village.”

[^55]: Masica 1991: 29.

[^56]: As Gilchrist (1820: xiii-xiv) himself describes it: "In every case where a native of hindoostan wishes either to compose or to dictate anything to be translated from his own to another tongue, he constantly arranges his ideas and explains his meaning in hindoostanee, before it be committed to writing as a Persian epistle, or  a political document of any value."

[^57]: Quoted in Lelyveld (1993: 670), from M. Atique Siddiqi’s (1963) Origins of Modern Hindustani Literature (Naya Kirab Garh).

[^58]: *Truly* painstaking work went into making the dictionary. Gilchrist began with “a” and slowly built on it, going to “ab”, then “abab”, “ababa”, “abach”, and so on and so forth, with his Hindustani employees telling him all the words that came to mind with each combination. 
Incidentally, just after he finished compiling his dictionary, Gilchrist discovered that another army captain, Captain Kirkpatrick, already had a Hindustani-English dictionary in the press. Gilchrist managed to convince Kirkpatrick to be his business associate – after all, the dictionary was an entrepreneurial undertaking more than anything else – and the two soon published a dictionary together.

[^60]: Shapiro 2004: 281

[^61]: In fact, being the entrepreneur he was, Gilchrist even devised his own system for transliterating Hindustani into the Roman alphabet with the goal of  making it easier for the British to learn (though it didn’t catch on in the end) (Lelyveld 1993: 671).

[^62]: Dr. J.F. Ballantyne in Benares – the professor who had asked his students why they hated Hindi so much – was of the same mindset as Gilchrist, if not of even stronger convictions. He wanted to clearly distinguish Hindi from all of the other dialects of the masses, and he wanted to “define and affirm Hindi in terms of a standardized and Sanskritized language created by a vernacular elite” (Rai 2001: 25).

[^63]: To support this claim, Chand (1944: 88) quotes Jules Bloch, author of *La formation de la Language Marathe* (*The formation of the Marathi Language*): "Lallu Lal, sous l’inspiration du Dr. Gilchrist, changea tout cela en ecrivant son celebre Prem Sagar, dont les parties en prose etaient en somme de l’ourdou dont less [sic] mots Persans auraient ete remplaces partout par des  mots Indo-aryens…Le  nouveau dialecte donna une ‘langue franque’ aux Hindus"
Lallu Lal, inspired by Dr. Gilchrist, changed everything by writing his celebrated Prem Sagar, in which the prose parts were as a whole Urdu with the Persian words replaced by Indo-Aryan words…the new dialect gave the Hindus a “*lingua franca*.”

[^65]: Rai 2001: 24.

[^66]: The idea that there should be one language for Muslims – Hindustani – and one for the Hindus – Hindi – would not take root until the British assumed full control, at which point it was imposed fairly quickly. For example, the 1886 *Hobson-Jobson: A Glossary of Colloquial Anglo-Indian Words and Phrases, and of Kindred Terms, Etymological, Historical, Geographical and Discursive* by Henry Yule and Arthur Coke Burnell (417) defines Hindustani as "properly an adjective, but used substantively in two senses, viz. (a) a native of Hindustan, and (b) (*Hindūstānī zabān*) ‘the language of the country,’ **but in fact the language that the Mahommedans of Upper India, eventually the Mahommedans of the Deccan, developed out of the Hindi dialect** of the Doab chiefly, and the territory around Agra and Delhi, with a mixture of Persian vocables and phrases, and a readiness to adopt other foreign words. It is also called *Oordoo*, i.e. the language of the Urdu (‘Horde’) or Camp. **This language was for a long time a kind of Mahommedan *lingua franca* over all India, and still possesses that character over a large part of the country, and among certain classes. Even in Madras, where it least prevails, it is still recognized in native regiments as the language of intercourse between officers and men. Old fashioned Anglo-Indians used to call it the *Moors* (q.v.)" [emphasis added].
See Faruqi (2001: 30-35) for other contemporary definitions of Hindustani and Urdu.
Earlier still, H.H. Wilson’s 1855 *A Glossary of the Judicial and Revenue Terms…of British India*, an analysis of the languages of the India, divided Indian languages into two types: Hindustani, and Hindu languages. Wilson, the Boden Professor of Sanskrit at Oxford, wrote that Hindustani was “an admixture of the original languages of the Mohammadan conquerors with those of the Hindus [and was] loosely spread, and at considerable intervals, over the surface” of India. Furthermore, different dialects of the Hindu population belonged to “clearly demarcated geographical regions”. Hindi, Wilson recognized, was not a very specific term, being used to refer to just about any language being spoken in India (quoted in Lelyveld 1993: 673).

[^72]: It was exactly this that the Court of the Directors of the East India Company advised in 1830: they wrote that “it is easier for the judge to acquire the language of the people than for the people to acquire the language of the judge.” (Quoted in King 1992: 185, from Malaviya, Madan Mohan *Court Character and Primary Education in N.W.P. and Oudh* (1897), Allahabad: Indian Press.)

[^73]: Not everyone saw it that way, though. For many, Urdu referred specifically to the highly-stylized, Persianized literary variety, and was different from (colloquial) Hindustani (Masica 1991: 30).

[^75]: In 1836, the Sadar Board of Revenue of the North-Western Provinces (NWP) had warned that the change from Persian to Urdu wouldn’t just be inserting some Urdu verbs and keeping Persian vocabulary and idioms, but that was basically what happened in the end (King 1992:185).

[^78]: As late as December of 1858, the famous Urdu poet Ghalib was uncomfortable with the term Urdu, which he employed in the masculine (which meant “city”), rather than the feminine (which meant the language).

[^79]: One of the high points of Urdu literature can be found in the letters of Ghalib (died 1869), who was one of the greatest Urdu poets and one of the last who still felt equally at home in Persian (Shackle and Snell 1990: 8).

[^83]: The only problem with this was that it meant admitting defeat for those same centuries, admitting that ever since the golden days of Ancient India when Sanskrit was king, the Hindus had been defeated by the Muslims. This furthermore also entailed some “complex feats of accommodation, of adjusting and massaging the historical record” to make things all fit together nicely (Rai 2001: 72).
